prologue
comets tail spread across dawn red slash bled crags dragonstone like wound pink purple sky
maester stood windswept balcony outside chambers ravens came long flight droppings speckled gargoyles rose twelve feet tall either side hellhound wyvern two thousand brooded walls ancient fortress first came dragonstone army stone grotesques made uneasy years passed grown used thought old friends three watched sky together foreboding

davos last night say
king together night
time lord stannis would woken matter hour give counsel told cressen complained woken disentangled fingers shireens pardons lady must speak lord father pylos give arm many steps castle seems add every night vex
shireen patchface followed child soon grew restless old mans creeping pace dashed ahead fool lurching cowbells clanging madly
castles friendly places frail cressen reminded descended turnpike stairs sea dragon tower lord stannis would found chamber painted table atop stone drum dragonstones central keep named way ancient walls boomed rumbled storms reach must cross gallery pass middle inner walls guardian gargoyles black iron gates ascend steps cressen cared contemplate young men climbed steps two time old men bad hips every one torment lord stannis would think come maester resigned ordeal pylos help least grateful
shuffling along gallery passed row tall arched windows commanding views outer bailey curtain wall fishing village beyond yard archers firing practice butts call notch draw loose arrows made sound like flock birds taking wing guardsmen strode wallwalks peering gargoyles host camped without morning air hazy smoke cookfires three thousand men sat break fasts beneath banners lords past sprawl camp anchorage crowded ships craft come within sight dragonstone past half year allowed leave lord stanniss fury triple decked war galley three hundred oars looked almost small beside big bellied carracks cogs surrounded
guardsmen outside stone drum knew maesters sight passed wait cressen told pylos within best see alone

cressen smiled think forgotten climbed steps often know one name
halfway regretted decision stopped catch breath ease pain hip heard scuff boots stone came face face ser davos seaworth descending
davos slight man low birth written plain upon common face well worn green cloak stained salt spray faded sun draped thin shoulders brown doublet breeches matched brown eyes hair neck pouch worn leather hung thong small beard well peppered grey wore leather glove maimed left hand saw cressen checked descent
ser davos maester said return
black morning favorite time said one ever handled ship night half well davos shorthand lord stannis knighted notorious elusive smuggler seven kingdoms
man shook head warned rise maester love
cressen thought ever strong able aye past point wisdom yet enough never enough spoke

bold little boy wild black hair laughing eyes man grown one twenty still played games look king cressen thought sadly oh renly renly dear sweet child know would care anyone cares reasons lords give refusals asked ser davos
well gave soft words blunt made excuses promises lied shrugged end words wind
could bring hope
false sort id davos said truth
maester cressen remembered day davos knighted siege storms end lord stannis small garrison held castle close year great host lords tyrell redwyne even sea closed watched day night redwyne galleys flying burgundy banners arbor within storms end horses long since eaten dogs cats gone garrison roots rats came night moon new black clouds hid stars cloaked darkness davos smuggler dared redwyne cordon rocks shipbreaker bay alike little ship black hull black sails black oars hold crammed onions salt fish little enough yet kept garrison alive long enough eddard stark reach storms end break siege
lord stannis rewarded davos choice lands cape wrath small keep knights honors also decreed lose joint finger left hand pay years smuggling davos submitted condition stannis wield knife would accept punishment lesser hands lord used butchers cleaver better cut clean true afterward davos chosen name seaworth new made house took banner black ship pale grey fieldwith onion sails onetime smuggler fond saying lord stannis done boon giving four less fingernails clean trim
cressen thought man like would give false hope soften hard truth ser davos truth bitter draught even man like lord stannis thinks returning kings landing fullness power tear enemies claim rightfully yet
takes meager host kings landing die numbers told much know pride davos held gloved hand fingers grow back man bends sense
old man sighed done could must add voice wearily resumed climb
lord stannis baratheons refuge great round room walls bare black stone four tall narrow windows looked four points compass center chamber great table took name massive slab carved wood fashioned command aegon targaryen days conquest painted table fifty feet long perhaps half wide widest point less four feet across narrowest aegons carpenters shaped land westeros sawing bay peninsula table nowhere ran straight surface darkened near three hundred years varnish painted seven kingdoms aegons day rivers mountains castles cities lakes forests
single chair room carefully positioned precise place dragonstone occupied coast westeros raised give good view tabletop seated chair man tight laced leather jerkin breeches roughspun brown wool maester cressen entered glanced knew would come old man whether summoned hint warmth voice seldom
stannis baratheon lord dragonstone grace gods rightful heir iron throne seven kingdoms westeros broad shoulder sinewy limb tightness face flesh spoke leather cured sun tough steel hard word men used spoke stannis hard though yet five thirty fringe thin black hair remained head circling behind ears like shadow crown brother late king robert grown beard final years maester cressen never seen said wild thing thick fierce answer stannis kept whiskers cropped tight short lay like blue black shadow across square jaw bony hollows cheeks eyes open wounds beneath heavy brows blue dark sea night mouth would given despair even drollest fools mouth made frowns scowls sharply worded commands thin pale lips clenched muscles mouth forgotten smile never known laugh sometimes world grew still silent night maester cressen fancied could hear lord stannis grinding teeth half castle away

young old sick need sleep stannis never learned soften speech dissemble flatter said thought like could damned knew youd learn davos say soon enough always dont

told suppose mans tongue shortened along fingers
would made poor envoy
made poor envoy case storm lords rise seems like justice cause means nothing cravenly ones sit behind walls waiting see wind rises likely triumph bold ones already declared renly renly spat name like poison tongue
brother lord storms end past thirteen years lords sworn bannermen
stannis broke rights mine never asked dragonstone never wanted took roberts enemies commanded root built fleet work dutiful younger brother elder renly roberts thanks names lord dragonstone gives storms end incomes renly storms end belonged house baratheon three hundred years rights passed robert took iron throne
old grievance deeply felt never heart lords weakness dragonstone old strong though commanded allegiance handful lesser lords whose stony island holdings thinly peopled yield men stannis needed even sellswords brought across narrow sea free cities myr lys host camped outside walls far small bring power house lannister
robert injustice maester cressen replied carefully yet sound reasons dragonstone long seat house targaryen needed mans strength rule renly child
child still stannis declared anger ringing loud empty hall thieving child thinks snatch crown brow renly ever done earn throne sits council jests littlefinger tourneys dons splendid suit armor allows knocked horse better man sum brother renly thinks ought king ask gods inflict brothers
cannot answer gods
seldom answer days seems maesters renly perchance send might like counsel better think maester said brother decided steal crown counsel colleague offer traitor blood mine
would surprise lord renly sought counsel grace youngest lord steffons three sons grown man bold heedless acted impulse rather calculation much else renly like brother robert utterly unlike stannis
grace stannis repeated bitterly mock kings style yet king dragonstone rocks narrow sea kingdom descended steps chair stand table shadow falling across mouth blackwater rush painted forest kings landing stood stood brooding realm sought claim near hand yet far away tonight sup lords bannermen celtigar velaryon bar emmon whole paltry lot poor crop truth told brothers left lysene pirate salladhor saan latest tally owe morosh myrman caution talk tides autumn gales lord sunglass mutters piously seven celtigar want know storm lords joining velaryon threaten take levies home unless strike tell must
true enemies lannisters lord maester cressen answered brother make common cause

renly maester yielded lord stubborn proud set mind changing others might serve needs well eddard starks son proclaimed king north power winterfell riverrun behind
green boy said stannis another false king accept broken realm

boy weak sickly lord stannis objected even father saw asked foster dragonstone service page might done good damnable lannister woman lord arryn poisoned could done lysa hides eyrie shell never part boy promise
must send shireen eyrie maester urged dragonstone grim home child let fool go familiar face
familiar hideous stannis furrowed brow thought still perhaps worth trying
must rightful lord seven kingdoms beg help widow women usurpers womans voice asked sharply
maester cressen turned bowed head lady said chagrined heard enter
lord stannis scowled beg anyone mind remember woman
pleased hear lord lady selyse tall husband thin body thin face prominent ears sharp nose faintest hint mustache upper lip plucked daily cursed regularly yet never failed return eyes pale mouth stern voice whip cracked lady arryn owes allegiance starks brother renly rest one true king would fitting plead bargain rightfully grace god
god said gods red woman heart soul turning gods seven kingdoms old new worship one called lord light

brothers uncles cousins armies told house florent rally banner
house florent field two thousand swords best said stannis knew strength every house seven kingdoms deal faith brothers uncles lady florent lands lie close highgarden lord uncle risk mace tyrells wrath
another way lady selyse moved closer look windows lord sign waited blazoned sky red red flame red fiery heart true god bannerand see unfurls across heavens like dragons hot breath lord dragonstone means time come grace nothing certain meant sail desolate rock aegon conqueror sailed sweep say word embrace power lord light
many swords lord light put hand stannis demanded

davos would tell different stannis said swords sworn renly love charming young brother loved robert never loved
yes answered renly die
stannis looked lady narrowed eyes cressen could hold tongue thought grace whatever follies renly committed
follies call treasons stannis turned back wife brother young strong vast host around rainbow knights
melisandre gazed flames seen dead
cressen horrorstruck fratricide lord evil unthinkable please listen
lady selyse gave measured look tell maester might win half kingdom goes starks knees sells daughter lysa arryn
heard counsel cressen lord stannis said hear dismissed
maester cressen bent stiff knee could feel lady selyses eyes back shuffled slowly across room time reached bottom steps could stand erect help said pylos
safe back rooms cressen sent younger man away limped balcony stand gargoyles stare sea one salladhor saans warships sweeping past castle gaily striped hull slicing grey green waters oars rose fell watched vanished behind headland would fears could vanish easily lived long

woman heart lady selyse one red woman servants named afraid speak name speak name cressen told stone hellhound melisandre melisandre asshai sorceress shadowbinder priestess rhllor lord light heart fire god flame shadow melisandre whose madness must allowed spread beyond dragonstone
chambers seemed dim gloomy brightness morning fumbling hands old man lit candle carried workroom beneath rookery stair ointments potions medicines stood neatly shelves bottom shelf behind row salves squat clay jars found vial indigo glass larger little finger rattled shook cressen blew away layer dust carried back table collapsing chair pulled stopper spilled vials contents dozen crystals larger seeds rattled across parchment hed reading shone like jewels candlelight purple maester found thinking never truly seen color

cressen longer recalled name asshaii gave leaf lysene poisoners crystal citadel simply called strangler dissolved wine would make muscles mans throat clench tighter fist shutting windpipe said victims face turned purple little crystal seed death grown man choking morsel food

brynden stood come outside best wake
followed onto stone balcony jutted three sided solar like prow ship uncle glanced frowning see day men call red messenger message
catelyn raised eyes faint red line comet traced path across deep blue sky like long scratch across face god greatjon told robb old gods unfurled red flag vengeance ned edmure thinks omen victory riverrunhe sees fish long tail tully colors red blue sighed wish faith crimson lannister color
things crimson ser brynden said tully red mud red river thats blood child smeared across sky

across rain sodden fields stony ridges could see great castle storms end rearing sky back unseen sea beneath mass pale grey stone encircling army lord stannis baratheon looked small insignificant mice banners
songs said storms end raised ancient days durran first storm king love fair elenei daughter sea god goddess wind night wedding elenei yielded maidenhood mortals love thus doomed mortals death grieving parents unleashed wrath sent winds waters batter durrans hold friends brothers wedding guests crushed beneath collapsing walls blown sea elenei sheltered durran within arms took harm dawn came last declared war upon gods vowed rebuild

stannis frowned else
renly gave easy shrug saw standard could certain whose banner bear
mine
red clad priestess spoke king taken sigil fiery heart lord light
renly seemed amused good use banner battle terribly confused
catelyn said let hope battle three share common foe would destroy
stannis studied unsmiling iron throne mine rights deny foes

tyrion
varys stood brazier warming soft hands would appear renly murdered fearfully midst army throat opened ear ear blade passed steel bone soft cheese
murdered whose hand cersei demanded
ever considered many answers answer informers always highly placed might like king dies fancies sprout like mushrooms dark groom says renly slain knight rainbow guard washerwoman claims stannis stole heart brothers army magic sword several men arms believe woman fell deed cannot agree woman maid renly spurned claims one camp follower brought serve pleasure eve battle says second third ventures might lady catelyn stark
queen pleased must waste time every rumor fools care tell
pay well rumors gracious queen
pay truth lord varys remember small council may grow smaller still
varys tittered nervously noble brother leave grace council continue
daresay realm could survive less councillors said littlefinger smile
dear dear petyr said varys concerned might next name hands little list
varys never dream
mayhaps brothers wall together varys giggled
sooner youd like next words mouth something useful eunuch look eyes cersei prepared castrate varys
might ruse asked littlefinger
ruse surpassing cleverness said varys certainly hoodwinked
tyrion heard enough joff disappointed said saving nice spike renlys head whoever deed must assume stannis behind gain clearly like news counted brothers baratheon decimating bloody battle could feel elbow throbbing morningstar laid open sometimes damp squeezed uselessly hand asked renlys host
greater part foot remains bitterbridge varys abandoned brazier take seat table lords rode lord renly storms end gone banner blade stannis chivalry
led florents id wager said littlefinger
varys gave simpering smile would win lord lord alester indeed first bend knee many others followed
many tyrion said pointedly
agreed eunuch loras tyrell randyll tarly mathis rowan storms end yielded ser cortnay penrose holds castle renlys name believe liege dead demands see mortal remains opens gates seems renlys corpse unaccountably vanished carried away likely fifth renlys knights departed ser loras rather bend knee stannis said knight flowers went mad saw kings body slew three renlys guards wrath among emmon cuy robar royce
pity stopped three thought tyrion
ser loras likely making bitterbridge varys went sister renlys queen well great many soldiers suddenly find kingless side take ticklish question many serve lords remained storms end lords belong stannis
tyrion leaned forward chance seems win loras tyrell cause lord mace tyrell bannermen might join well may sworn swords stannis moment yet cannot love man would start
love greater asked cersei
scarcely said tyrion loved renly clearly renly slain perhaps give good sufficient reasons prefer joffrey stannis move quickly
sort reasons mean give
gold reasons littlefinger suggested
varys made tsking sound sweet petyr surely mean suggest puissant lords noble knights could bought like many chickens market
markets late lord varys asked littlefinger youd find easier buy lord chicken daresay course lords cluck prouder chickens take ill offer coin like tradesman seldom adverse taking gifts honors lands castles
bribes might sway lesser lords tyrion said never highgarden
true littlefinger admitted knight flowers key mace tyrell two older sons loras always favorite win highgarden
yes tyrion thought seems take lesson late lord renly win tyrell alliance marriage
varys understood quickest think wed king joffrey margaery tyrell
renlys young queen fifteen sixteen seemed recall older joffrey years nothing neat sweet could taste
joffrey betrothed sansa stark cersei objected
marriage contracts broken advantage wedding king daughter dead traitor
littlefinger spoke might point grace tyrells much wealthier starks margaery said lovely beddable besides
yes said tyrion joff ought like well enough
son young care things
think asked tyrion hes thirteen cersei age married
shamed sorry episode joffrey made finer stuff
fine ser boros rip sansas gown
angry girl
angry cooks boy spilled soup last night well didnt strip naked
matter spilled soup
matter pretty teats business yard tyrion spoken varys might arrange joffrey visit chatayas taste honey might sweeten boy hoped might even grateful gods forbid tyrion could shade gratitude sovereign would need done secretly course tricky bit would parting hound dog never far masters heels hed observed varys men sleep gamble whore visit winesinks well
hound things question
said tyrion question
varys laid finger cheek smiling enigmatically lord suspicious man might think wished find time sandor clegane protecting king joffrey better boy harm
surely know better lord varys tyrion said want joffrey love
eunuch promised look matter war made demands though joffreys initiation manhood would need wait doubtless know son better made tell cersei regardless theres still much said tyrell marriage may way joffrey lives long enough reach wedding night
littlefinger agreed stark girl brings joffrey nothing body sweet may margaery tyrell brings fifty thousand swords strength highgarden
indeed varys laid soft hand queens sleeve mothers heart know grace loves little sweetling yet kings must learn put needs realm desires say offer must made
queen pulled free eunuchs touch would speak women say lords joffrey proud settle renlys leavings never consent
tyrion shrugged king comes age three years may give withhold consent pleases regent hand marry whomever tell marry leavings
cerseis quiver empty make offer gods save joff like girl
pleased agree tyrion said shall go bitterbridge must reach ser loras offer blood cool
mean send one council
scarcely expect knight flowers treat bronn shagga tyrells proud
sister wasted time trying twist situation advantage ser jacelyn bywater nobly born send
tyrion shook head need someone repeat words fetch back reply envoy must speak king council settle matter quickly
hand speaks kings voice candlelight gleamed green wildfire cerseis eyes send tyrion joffrey went better wield words skillfully jaime wields sword
eager get city cersei kind sister seems boys mother better fitted arrange marriage uncle gift winning friends could never hope match
eyes narrowed joff needs side
grace lord hand said littlefinger king needs let go stead
gain see tyrion wondered
kings council yet kings blood would make poor hostage knew ser loras passing well court gave cause mislike mace tyrell bears enmity know flatter unskilled negotiation
tyrion trust petyr baelish want man sight yet choice left must littlefinger tyrion knew full well left kings landing length time managed accomplish would undone fighting bitterbridge said cautiously past certain lord stannis dispatching shepherds gather brothers wayward lambs
ive never frightened shepherds sheep trouble still suppose escort might order
spare hundred gold cloaks tyrion said
five hundred
three hundred
forty moretwenty knights many squires arrive without knightly tail tyrells think small account
true enough agreed
ill include horror slobber party send lord father afterward gesture goodwill need paxter redwyne hes mace tyrells oldest friend great power right
traitor queen said balking arbor would declared renly rest except redwyne knew full well whelps would suffer
renly dead grace littlefinger pointed neither stannis lord paxter forgotten redwyne galleys closed sea siege storms end restore twins perchance may win redwynes love
cersei remained unconvinced others keep love want swords sails holding tight twins best way make certain well
tyrion answer let send ser hobber back arbor keep ser horas lord paxter ought clever enough riddle meaning think
suggestion carried without protest littlefinger done well want horses swift strong fighting make remounts hard come goodly supply gold also needed gifts spoke earlier
take much require city falls stannis steal anyway
ill want commission writing document leave mace tyrell doubt authority granting full power treat concerning match arrangements might required make binding pledges kings name signed joffrey every member council bear seals
tyrion shifted uncomfortably done remind theres long road bitterbridge
ill riding dawn breaks littlefinger rose trust return king see suitably rewarded valiant efforts cause
varys giggled joffrey grateful sovereign certain cause complain good brave lord
queen direct want petyr
littlefinger glanced tyrion sly smile shall need give consideration doubt ill think something sketched airy bow took leave casual one brothels
tyrion glanced window fog thick could even see curtain wall across yard dim lights shone indistinct greyness foul day travel thought envy petyr baelish best see drawing documents lord varys send parchment quill someone need wake joffrey
still grey dark meeting finally ended varys scurried alone soft slippers whisking along floor lannisters lingered moment door comes chain brother queen asked ser preston fastened vair lined cloth silver cloak shoulders
link link grows longer thank gods ser cortnay penrose stubborn stannis never march north storms end untaken rear
tyrion know always agree policy seems wrong big fool imagined truth realize great help thank must forgive spoken harshly past
must gave shrug smile sweet sister said nothing requires forgiveness
today mean laughed cersei leaned planted quick soft kiss brow
astonished words tyrion could watch stride hall ser preston side lost wits sister kiss asked bronn gone
sweet
unanticipated cersei behaving queerly late tyrion found unsettling trying recall last time kissed could six seven jaime dared
womans finally taken note charms
tyrion said woman hatching something best find bronn know hate surprises

night made camp brienne sought tent lady safely back among days ride brothers castle give leave go
catelyn surprised homely young woman kept journey spending time horses brushing coats pulling stones shoes helped shadd cook clean game well soon proved could hunt well task catelyn asked turn hand brienne performed deftly without complaint spoken answered politely never chattered wept laughed ridden every day slept among every night without ever truly becoming one
renly catelyn thought feast melee even renlys pavilion brothers rainbow guard walls around one higher winterfells

back brienne said storms end
alone question
broad face pool still water giving hint might live depths yes
mean kill stannis
brienne closed thick callused fingers around hilt sword sword swore vow three times swore heard
catelyn admitted girl kept rainbow cloak discarded rest bloodstained clothing knew briennes things left behind flight forced clothe odd bits ser wendels spare garb since one else party garments large enough fit vows kept agree stannis great host around guards sworn keep safe

catelyn glanced across camp two men walking sentry spears hand taught good men must fight evil world renlys death evil beyond doubt yet also taught gods make kings swords men stannis rightful king
hes robert never rightful king either even renly said much jaime lannister murdered rightful king robert killed lawful heir trident gods gods dont care men kings care peasants
good king care
lord renly grace would best king lady good
gone brienne said gently could stannis joffrey remain son
wouldnt youd never make peace stannis would bend knee wouldnt
tell true brienne know son may king queen mother would keep children safe however could
made mother need fight
fight living dead renlys enemies robbs enemies well
brienne stared ground shuffled feet know son lady looked could serve would
catelyn startled
question seemed trouble brienne helped pavilion thought
innocent
even could let kill nothing
perhaps want one knew dark truth happened catelyn thought brienne taken many wellborn ladies service years never one like battle commander
courage battle courage perhaps dont know kind womans courage think time comes try hold back promise hold back stannis
catelyn could still hear stannis saying robbs turn would come time like cold breath back neck time comes hold back
tall girl knelt awkwardly unsheathed renlys longsword laid feet lady liege man whatever would shield back keep counsel give life need swear old gods new
vow shall always place hearth meat mead table pledge ask service might bring dishonor swear old gods new arise clasped womans hands catelyn could help smile many times watch ned accept mans oath service wondered would think could see

daenerys
city splendors dany expected house undying ones splendid emerged palanquin behold grey ancient ruin
long low without towers windows coiled like stone serpent grove black barked trees whose inky blue leaves made stuff sorcerous drink qartheen called shade evening buildings stood near black tiles covered palace roof many fallen broken mortar stones dry crumbling understood xaro xhoan daxos called palace dust even drogon seemed disquieted sight black dragon hissed smoke seeping sharp teeth
blood blood jhogo said dothraki evil place haunt ghosts maegi see drinks morning sun let go drinks well
ser jorah mormont came beside power live
heed wisdom love best said xaro xhoan daxos lounging inside palanquin warlocks bitter creatures eat dust drink shadows give naught naught give
aggo put hand arakh khaleesi said many go palace dust come

places even khal must walk alone dany said
take ser jorah urged risk
queen daenerys must enter alone warlock pyat pree stepped trees along dany wondered turn away doors wisdom shall closed forevermore
pleasure barge awaits even xaro xhoan daxos called turn away folly stubborn queens flutists soothe troubled soul sweet music small girl whose tongue make sigh melt
ser jorah mormont gave merchant prince sour look grace remember mirri maz duur
dany said suddenly decided remember knowledge maegi
pyat pree smiled thinly child speaks sagely crone take arm let lead
child dany took arm nonetheless
darker would thought black trees way longer though path seemed run straight street door palace pyat pree soon turned aside questioned warlock said front way leads never heed words queen house undying ones made mortal men value soul take care tell

reached doora tall oval mouth set wall fashioned likeness human facethe smallest dwarf dany ever seen waiting threshold stood higher knee faced pinched pointed snoutish dressed delicate livery purple blue tiny pink hands held silver tray upon rested slender crystal glass filled thick blue liquid shade evening wine warlocks take drink urged pyat pree
turn lips blue
one flute serve unstop ears dissolve caul eyes may hear see truths laid
dany raised glass lips first sip tasted like ink spoiled meat foul swallowed seemed come life within could feel tendrils spreading chest like fingers fire coiling around heart tongue taste like honey anise cream like mothers milk drogos seed like red meat hot blood molten gold tastes ever known none glass empty
may enter said warlock dany put glass back servitors tray went inside
found stone anteroom four doors one wall never hesitation went door right stepped second room twin first turned right hand door pushed open faced yet another small antechamber four doors presence sorcery
fourth room oval rather square walled worm eaten wood place stone six passages led place four dany chose rightmost entered long dim high ceilinged hall along right hand row torches burning smoky orange light doors left drogon unfolded wide black wings beat stale air flew twenty feet thudding undignified crash dany strode
mold eaten carpet feet gorgeously colored whorls gold could still seen fabric glinting broken amidst faded grey mottled green remained served muffle footfalls good dany could hear sounds within walls faint scurrying scrabbling made think rats drogon heard head moved followed sounds stopped gave angry scream sounds even disturbing came closed doors one shook thumped someone trying break another came dissonant piping made dragon lash tail wildly side side dany hurried quickly past
doors closed look dany told temptation strong
one room beautiful woman sprawled naked floor four little men crawled rattish pointed faces tiny pink hands like servitor brought glass shade one pumping thighs another savaged breasts worrying nipples wet red mouth tearing chewing
farther came upon feast corpses savagely slaughtered feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs hacked trestle tables asprawl pools congealing blood lost limbs even heads severed hands clutched bloody cups wooden spoons roast fowl heels bread throne sat dead man head wolf wore iron crown held leg lamb one hand king might hold scepter eyes followed dany mute appeal
fled far next open door know room thought remembered great wooden beams carved animal faces adorned outside window lemon tree sight made heart ache longing house red door house braavos sooner thought old ser willem came room leaning heavily stick little princess said gruff kind voice come said come lady youre home youre safe big wrinkled hand reached soft old leather dany wanted take hold kiss wanted much ever wanted anything foot edged forward thought hes dead hes dead sweet old bear died long time ago backed away ran
long hall went endless doors left torches right ran past doors could count closed doors open ones doors wood doors iron carved doors plain ones doors pulls doors locks doors knockers drogon lashed back urging dany ran could run
finally great pair bronze doors appeared left grander rest swung open neared stop look beyond loomed cavernous stone hall largest ever seen skulls dead dragons looked walls upon towering barbed throne sat old man rich robes old man dark eyes long silver grey hair let king charred bones cooked meat said man let king ashes drogon shrieked claws digging silk skin king throne never heard dany moved
viserys first thought next time paused second glance told otherwise man brothers hair taller eyes dark indigo rather lilac aegon said woman nursing newborn babe great wooden bed better name king
make song woman asked
song man replied prince promised song ice fire looked said eyes met danys seemed saw standing beyond door must one said though whether speaking woman bed could say dragon three heads went window seat picked harp ran fingers lightly silvery strings sweet sadness filled room man wife babe faded like morning mist music lingering behind speed way
seemed though walked another hour long hall finally ended steep stone stair descending darkness every door open closed left dany looked back behind torches going realized start fear perhaps twenty still burned thirty one guttered even watched darkness came little farther hall creeping toward listened seemed heard something else coming shuffling dragging slowly along faded carpet terror filled could go back afraid stay could go door right steps went
yet another torch went stood pondering sounds grew faintly louder drogons long neck snaked opened mouth scream steam rising teeth hears dany turned blank wall nothing could secret door door cannot see another torch went another first door right said always first door right first door right
came suddenly last door left
flung beyond another small room four doors right went right right right right right right dizzy breath
stopped found yet another dank stone chamber time door opposite round shaped like open mouth pyat pree stood outside grass beneath trees undying done soon asked disbelief saw
soon said confused ive walked hours still found
taken wrong turning come lead pyat pree held hand
dany hesitated door right still closed
thats way pyat pree said firmly blue lips prim disapproval undying ones wait forever
little lives flicker moths wing dany said remembering
stubborn child lost never found
walked away door right
pyat screeched come meeeeeee face crumbled inward changing something pale wormlike
dany left behind entering stairwell began climb long legs aching recalled house undying ones seemed towers
finally stair opened right set wide wooden doors thrown open fashioned ebony weirwood black white grains swirling twisting strange interwoven patterns beautiful yet somehow frightening blood dragon must afraid dany said quick prayer begging warrior courage dothraki horse god strength made walk forward
beyond doors great hall splendor wizards wore sumptuous robes ermine ruby velvet cloth gold others fancied elaborate armor studded gemstones tall pointed hats speckled stars women among dressed gowns surpassing loveliness shafts sunlight slanted windows stained glass air alive beautiful music ever heard
kingly man rich robes rose saw smiled daenerys house targaryen welcome come share food forever undying qarth

took step forward drogon leapt shoulder flew top ebony weirwood door perched began bite carved wood
willful beast laughed handsome young man shall teach secret speech dragonkind come come
doubt seized great door heavy took danys strength budge finally began move behind another door hidden old grey wood splintery plain stood right door shed entered wizards beckoning voices sweeter song ran drogon flying back narrow door passed chamber awash gloom
long stone table filled room floated human heart swollen blue corruption yet still alive beat deep ponderous throb sound pulse sent wash indigo light figures around table blue shadows dany walked empty chair foot table stir speak turn face sound slow deep beat rotting heart

indigo murk could make wizened features undying one right old old man wrinkled hairless flesh ripe violet blue lips nails bluer still dark almost black even whites eyes blue stared unseeing ancient woman opposite side table whose gown pale silk rotted body one withered breast left bare qartheen manner show pointed blue nipple hard leather

shape shadows morrows yet made drink cup ice drink cup fire
mother dragons child three
three understand
three heads dragon ghost chorus yammered inside skull never lip moving never breath stirring still blue air mother dragons child storm whispers became swirling song three fires must light one life one death one love heart beating unison one floated blue corrupt three mounts must ride one bed one dread one love voices growing louder realized seemed heart slowing even breath three treasons know blood gold love

phantoms shivered murk images indigo viserys screamed molten gold ran cheeks filled mouth tall lord copper skin silver gold hair stood beneath banner fiery stallion burning city behind rubies flew like drops blood chest dying prince sank knees water last breath murmured womans name mother dragons daughter death glowing like sunset red sword raised hand blue eyed king cast shadow cloth dragon swayed poles amidst cheering crowd smoking tower great stone beast took wing breathing shadow fire mother dragons slayer lies silver trotting grass darkling stream beneath sea stars corpse stood prow ship eyes bright dead face grey lips smiling sadly blue flower grew chink wall ice filled air sweetness mother dragons bride fire

moon rose ebben parted stonesnake went east short way doubled back obscure tracks three remained set toward southwest
days nights blurred one slept saddles stopped long enough feed water garrons mounted bare rock rode gloomy pine forests drifts old snow icy ridges across shallow rivers names sometimes qhorin stonesnake would loop back sweep away tracks futile gesture watched every dawn every dusk saw eagle soaring peaks speck vastness sky
scaling low ridge two snowcapped peaks shadowcat came snarling lair ten yards away beast gaunt half starved sight sent stonesnakes mare panic reared ran ranger could get back control stumbled steep slope broken leg
ghost ate well day qhorin insisted rangers mix garrons blood oats give strength taste foul porridge almost choked jon forced cut dozen strips raw stringy meat carcass chew rode left rest shadowcats
question riding double stonesnake offered lay wait pursuit surprise came perhaps could take hell qhorin refused man nights watch make frostfangs alone afoot brother go mountains horse must go around make fist tell mormont jon saw tell old powers waking faces giants wargs worse tell trees eyes
chance jon thought watched stonesnake vanish snow covered ridge tiny black bug crawling across rippling expanse white
every night seemed colder night lonely ghost always never far either even apart jon sensed nearness glad halfhand companionable men qhorins long grey braid swung slowly motion horse often would ride hours without word spoken sounds soft scrape horseshoes stone keening wind blew endlessly heights slept dream wolves brothers anything even dreams cannot live told
sword sharp jon snow asked qhorin halfhand across flickering fire
sword valyrian steel old bear gave
remember words vow
yes words man like forget said could never unsaid changed life forever
say jon snow
like voices blended one beneath rising moon ghost listened mountains bore witness night gathers watch begins shall end death shall take wife hold lands father children shall wear crowns win glory shall live die post sword darkness watcher walls fire burns cold light brings dawn horn wakes sleepers shield guards realms men pledge life honor nights watch night nights come
done sound faint crackle flames distant sigh wind jon opened closed burnt fingers holding tight words mind praying fathers gods would give strength die bravely hour came would long garrons near end strength qhorins mount would last another day jon suspected
flames burning low warmth fading fire soon go qhorin said wall ever fall fires go
nothing jon could say nodded
may escape yet ranger said
afraid die half lie
may easy jon
understand mean
taken must yield
yield blinked disbelief wildlings make captives men called crows killed except spare oathbreakers join like mance rayder
shook head never wont

jon asked

ill say jon said reluctantly tell wont old bear least youll tell never broke oath
qhorin halfhand gazed across fire eyes lost pools shadow see next swear gestured fire wood want bright hot
jon went cut branches snapping one two tossing flames tree dead long time seemed live fire fiery dancers woke within stick wood whirl spin glowing gowns yellow red orange
enough qhorin said abruptly ride
ride dark beyond fire night cold ride
back qhorin mounted weary garron one time fire draw past hope come brother
jon pulled gloves raised hood even horses seemed reluctant leave fire sun long gone cold silver shine half moon remained light way treacherous ground lay behind know qhorin mind perhaps chance hoped want play oathbreaker even good reason
went cautiously moving silent man horse could move retracing steps reached mouth narrow defile icy little stream emerged two mountains jon remembered place watered horses sun went
waters icing qhorin observed turned aside else wed ride streambed break ice like see keep close cliffs theres crook half mile hide rode defile jon gave one last wistful look distant fire followed
farther went closer cliffs pressed either side followed moonlit ribbon stream back toward source icicles bearded stony banks jon could still hear sound rushing water beneath thin hard crust
great jumble fallen rock blocked way partway section cliff face fallen surefooted little garrons able pick way beyond walls pinched sharply stream led foot tall twisting waterfall air full mist like breath vast cold beast tumbling waters shone silver moonlight jon looked dismay way qhorin might able climb cliffs horses think would last long afoot
quickly halfhand commanded big man small horse rode ice slick stones right curtain water vanished reappear jon put heels horse went garron best shy away falling water slapped frozen fists shock cold seemed stop jons breath
drenched shivering
cleft rock barely large enough man horse pass beyond walls opened floor turned soft sand jon could feel spray freezing beard ghost burst waterfall angry rush shook droplets fur sniffed darkness suspiciously lifted leg one rocky wall qhorin already dismounted jon knew place
older heard brother tell followed shadowcat falls unsaddled horse removed bit bridle ran fingers shaggy mane way heart mountain come dawn found press first watch mine brother qhorin seated sand back wall vague black shadow gloom cave rush falling waters jon heard soft sound steel leather could mean halfhand drawn sword
took wet cloak cold damp strip ghost stretched beside licked glove curling sleep jon grateful warmth wondered fire still burning outside gone wall ever fall fires go moon shone curtain falling water lay shimmering pale stripe across sand time faded went dark
sleep came last nightmares dreamed burning castles dead men rising unquiet graves still dark qhorin woke halfhand slept jon sat back cave wall listening water waiting dawn
break day chewed half frozen strip horsemeat saddled garrons fastened black cloaks around shoulders watch halfhand made half dozen torches soaking bundles dry moss oil carried saddlebag lit first one led way dark holding pale flame jon followed horses stony path twisted turned first steeply spots grew narrow hard convince garrons could squeeze time come lost told went even eagle see solid stone lost ride hard fist tell old bear know
emerged back light long hours later eagle waiting perched dead tree hundred feet slope ghost went bounding rocks bird flapped wings took air
qhorins mouth tightened followed flight eyes good place make stand declared mouth cave shelters cannot get behind without passing mountain sword sharp jon snow
yes said
well feed horses theyve served bravely poor beasts
jon gave garron last oats stroked shaggy mane ghost prowled restlessly amongst rocks pulled gloves tighter flexed burnt fingers shield guards realms men
hunting horn echoed mountains moment later jon heard baying hounds soon announced qhorin keep wolf hand
ghost jon called direwolf returned reluctantly side tail held stiffly behind
wildlings came boiling ridge half mile away hounds ran snarling grey brown beasts little wolf blood ghost bared teeth fur bristling easy jon murmured stay overhead heard rustle wings eagle landed outcrop rock screamed triumph
hunters approached warily perhaps fearing arrows jon counted fourteen eight dogs large round shields made skins stretched woven wicker painted skulls half hid faces behind crude helms wood boiled leather either wing archers notched shafts strings small wood horn bows loose rest seemed armed spears mauls one chipped stone axe wore bits armor looted dead rangers stolen raids wildlings mine smelt smiths fewer forges north wall
