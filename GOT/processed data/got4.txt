podricks mouth gaped open hear

old cersei asked abruptly

younger man would please
tongue flicked across lips two forty conclave called kaeth eighty chose ellendor nigh ninety cares office crushed dead within year raised merion came next six sixty died chill way kings landing afterward king aegon asked citadel send younger man first king served

grace wish dream
say ears grown feeble cock make potion must command lord qyburn rectify another failures
need involve involve qyburn dreamless sleep shall potion
good may go turned toward door though called back one thing citadel teach concerning prophecy morrows foretold
old man hesitated one wrinkled hand groped blindly chest stroke beard morrows foretold repeated slowly mayhaps certain spells old books grace might ask instead morrows foretold answer doors best left closed
see close mine leave known would give answer useless

whatever intended late sense dwelling things better dies told would want go living without husband oaf fool seemed fond another matter last night dreadful dream

samwell
perilous part voyage last redwyne straits swarming longships warned tyrosh main strength arbors fleet far side westeros ironmen sacked ryamsport taken vinetown starfish harbor using bases prey shipping bound oldtown
thrice longships sighted crows nest two well astern however cinnamon wind soon outdistanced third appeared near sunset cut whispering sound saw oars rising falling lashing copper waters white kojja mo sent archers castles great bows goldenheart could send shaft farther truer even dornish yew waited till longship came within two hundred yards gave command loose sam loosed time thought arrow reached ship one volley took longship veered south search tamer prey
deep blue dusk falling entered whispering sound gilly stood beside prow babe gazing castle cliffs three towers sam told seat house costayne etched evening stars torchlight flickering windows castle made splendid sight sad see voyage almost end
tall said gilly
wait see hightower
dallas babe began cry gilly pulled open tunic gave boy breast smiled nursed stroked soft brown hair come love one much one left behind sam realized hoped gods would kind children
ironmen penetrated even sheltered waters whispering sound come morning cinnamon wind continued toward oldtown began bump corpses drifting sea bodies carried complements crows rose air complaining noisily swan ship disturbed grotesquely swollen rafts scorched fields burned villages appeared banks shallows sandbars strewn shattered ships merchanters fishing boats common saw abandoned longships wreckage two big dromonds one burned waterline whilst gaping splintered hole side hull rammed
battle said xhondo long
would mad raid close oldtown
xhondo pointed half sunken longship shallows remnants banner drooped stern smoke stained ragged charge one sam never seen red eye black pupil beneath black iron crown supported two crows whose banner sam asked xhondo shrugged
next day cold misty cinnamon wind creeping past another plundered fishing village war galley came sliding fog stroking slowly toward huntress name bore behind figurehead slender maiden clad leaves brandishing spear heartbeat later two smaller galleys appeared either side like pair matched greyhounds stalking masters heels sams relief flew king tommens stag lion banner stepped white tower oldtown crown flame
captain huntress tall man smoke grey cloak border red satin flames brought galley alongside cinnamon wind raised oars shouted coming aboard crossbowmen kojja mos archers eyed across narrow span water crossed half dozen knights gave quhuru mo nod asked see holds father daughter conferred briefly agreed
apologies captain said inspection complete grieves honest men must suffer discourtesy sooner ironmen oldtown fortnight ago bloody bastards captured tyroshi merchantman straits killed crew donned clothes used dyes found color whiskers half hundred colors inside walls meant set port ablaze open gate within whilst fought fire might worked ran afoul lady tower oarsmaster tyroshi wife saw green purple beards hailed tongue tyrosh one words hail back
sam aghast cannot mean raid oldtown
captain huntress gave curious look mere reavers ironmen always raided could would strike sudden sea carry gold girls sail away seldom one two longships never half dozen hundreds ships afflict sailing shield islands rocks around arbor taken stonecrab cay isle pigs mermaids palace nests horseshoe rock bastards cradle without lord redwynes fleet lack ships come grips
lord hightower sam blurted father always said wealthy lannisters could command thrice many swords highgardens bannermen
sweeps cobblestones captain said swords good ironmen unless men wield know walk water
hightower must something
sure lord leytons locked atop tower mad maid consulting books spells might hell raise army deeps baelors building galleys gunthor charge harbor garth training new recruits humfreys gone lys hire sellsails winkle proper fleet whore sister start paying back ironmen coin till best guard sound wait bitch queen kings landing let lord paxter leash
bitterness captains final words shocked sam much things said kings landing loses oldtown arbor whole realm fall pieces thought watched huntress sisters moving
made wonder even horn hill truly safe tarly lands lay inland amidst thickly wooded foothills hundred leagues northeast oldtown long way coast well beyond reach ironmen longships even lord father fighting riverlands castle lightly held young wolf doubt thought true winterfell night theon turncloak scaled walls sam could bear thought might brought gilly babe long way keep harm abandon midst war
wrestled doubts rest voyage wondering could keep gilly oldtown supposed citys walls much formidable fathers castle thousands men defend opposed handful lord randyll would left horn hill marched highgarden answer liege lords summons though would need hide somehow citadel permit novices keep wives paramours least openly besides stay gilly much longer ever find strength leave leave desert said words sam reminded desert mean head help gilly
considered begging kojja mo father take wildling girl summer isles path perils however cinnamon wind left oldtown would need cross redwyne straits time might fortunate wind died summer islanders found becalmed tales hed heard true gilly would carried thrall salt wife babe like chucked sea nuisance
horn hill sam finally decided reach oldtown ill hire wagon horses take way could make certain castle garrison part saw heard gave pause could turn around bring gilly back oldtown
reached oldtown cold damp morning fog thick beacon hightower part city seen boom stretched across harbor linking two dozen rotted hulks behind stood line warships anchored three big dromonds lord hightowers towering four decked banner ship honor oldtown cinnamon wind submit inspection time lord leytons son gunthor came aboard cloth silver cloak suit grey enameled scales ser gunthor studied citadel several years spoke summer tongue qurulu mo adjourned captains cabin privy conference
sam used time explain plans gilly first citadel present jons letters tell maester aemons death expect archmaesters send cart body arrange horses wagon take mother horn hill back soon may morrow
morrow repeated gave kiss luck
length ser gunthor reemerged gave signal chain opened cinnamon wind could slip boom dock sam joined kojja mo three archers near gangplank swan ship tying summer islanders resplendent feathered cloaks wore ashore felt shabby thing beside baggy blacks faded cloak salt stained boots long remain port
two days ten days say however long takes empty holds fill kojja grinned father must visit grey maesters well books sell
gilly stay aboard till return
gilly stay long likes poked sam belly finger eat much
fat sam said defensively passage south seen watches nothing eat fruit fish summer islanders loved fruit fish
sam followed archers across plank ashore parted company went separate ways hoped still remembered way citadel oldtown maze time getting lost
day damp cobblestones wet slippery underfoot alleys shrouded mist mystery sam avoided best could stayed river road wound along beside honeywine heart old city felt good solid ground beneath feet instead rolling deck walk made feel uncomfortable could feel eyes peering balconies windows watching darkened doorways cinnamon wind known every face everywhere turned saw another stranger even worse thought seen someone knew lord randyll tarly known oldtown little loved sam know would worse recognized one lord fathers enemies one friends pulled cloak quickened pace
gates citadel flanked pair towering green sphinxes bodies lions wings eagles tails serpents one mans face one womans beyond stood scribes hearth oldtowners came search acolytes write wills read letters half dozen bored scribes sat open stalls waiting custom stalls books bought sold sam stopped one offered maps looked hand drawn map citadel ascertain shortest way seneschals court
path divided statue king daeron first sat astride tall stone horse sword lifted toward dorne seagull perched young dragons head two blade sam took left fork ran beside river weeping dock watched two acolytes help old man boat short voyage bloody isle young mother climbed babe much older gillys squalling arms beneath dock cooks boys waded shallows gathering frogs stream pink cheeked novices hurried toward septry come age sam thought run taken false name could disappeared amongst novices father could pretended dickon son doubt would even troubled search unless took mule ride would hunted mule
outside seneschals court rectors locking older novice stocks stealing food kitchens one explained acolytes waiting pelt captive rotting vegetables gave sam curious looks strode past black cloak billowing behind like sail
beyond doors found hall stone floor high arched windows far end man pinched face sat upon raised dais scratching ledger quill though man clad maesters robe chain neck sam cleared throat good morrow

far isle ravens
need boat reach isle ravens weathered wooden drawbridge linked eastern bank ravenry oldest building citadel alleras told crossed slow flowing waters honeywine age heroes supposedly stronghold pirate lord sat robbing ships came river
moss creeping vines covered walls sam saw ravens walked battlements place archers drawbridge raised living memory
cool dim inside castle walls ancient weirwood filled yard since stones first raised carved face trunk grown purple moss hung heavy trees pale limbs half branches seemed dead elsewhere red leaves still rustled ravens liked perch tree full arched windows overhead around yard ground speckled droppings crossed yard one flapped overhead heard others quorking archmaester walgrave chambers west tower white rookery alleras told white ravens black ones quarrel like dornishmen marchers keep apart
archmaester walgrave understand telling wondered sam said wits prone wander
good days bad ones said alleras walgrave youre going see opened door north tower began climb sam clambered steps behind flutterings mutterings angry scream ravens complained woken
top steps pale blond youth sams age sat outside door oak iron staring intently candle flame right eye left hidden beneath fall ash blond hair looking alleras asked destiny death
blond youth turned candle blinking naked women said whos
samwell new novice come see mage
citadel complained blond take anything days dusky dogs dornishmen pig boys cripples cretins black clad whale thought leviathans grey half cape striped green gold draped one shoulder handsome though eyes sly mouth cruel
sam knew leo tyrell saying name made feel still boy seven wet smallclothes sam horn hill lord randyll tarlys son
truly leo gave another look suppose father told dead wished grinned still craven
lied sam jon made command went beyond wall fought battles call sam slayer know said words tumbled
leo laughed could reply door behind opened get slayer growled man doorway sphinx
sam said alleras archmaester marwyn
marwyn wore chain many metals around bulls neck save looked like dockside thug maester head big body way thrust forward shoulders together slab jaw made look tear someones head though short squat heavy chest shoulders round rock hard ale belly straining laces leather jerkin wore place robes bristly white hair sprouted ears nostrils brow beetled nose broken sourleaf stained teeth mottled red biggest hands sam ever seen
sam hesitated one hands grabbed arm yanked door room beyond large round books scrolls everywhere strewn across tables stacked floor piles four feet high faded tapestries ragged maps covered stone walls fire burning hearth beneath copper kettle whatever inside smelled burned aside light came tall black candle center room
candle unpleasantly bright something queer flame flicker even archmaester marwyn closed door hard papers blew nearby table light something strange colors whites bright fresh fallen snow yellow shone like gold reds turned flame shadows black looked like holes world sam found staring candle three feet tall slender sword ridged twisted glittering black
obsidian said man room pale fleshy pasty faced young fellow round shoulders soft hands close set eyes food stains robes
call dragonglass archmaester marwyn glanced candle moment burns consumed

feeds dragons fire marwyn seated upon stool valyrian sorcery rooted blood fire sorcerers freehold could see across mountains seas deserts one glass candles could enter mans dreams give visions speak one another half world apart seated candles think might useful slayer
would need ravens
battles archmaester peeled sourleaf bale shoved mouth began chew tell told dornish sphinx know much small parts may escaped notice

alleras stepped next sam aemon would gone strength wanted send maester counsel protect fetch safely home
archmaester marwyn shrugged perhaps good died got oldtown elsewise grey sheep might kill would made poor old dears wring wrinkled hands

sam sputtered archmaesters seneschal tell

alleras answered archmaester already gone heard boots stomping steps
gone asked sam bewildered
docks mage man believes wasting time alleras smiled confession chance encounter sam mage sent snatch spoke theobald knew coming
alleras nodded glass candle
sam stared strange pale flame moment blinked looked away outside window growing dark
theres empty sleeping cell mine west tower steps lead right walgraves chambers said pasty faced youth dont mind ravens quorking theres good view honeywine serve
suppose sleep somewhere
bring woolen coverlets stone walls turn cold night even
thanks something pale soft youth misliked want seem discourteous added names slayer truly sam samwell tarly

could hear dead man coming steps slow measured sound footsteps went echoing amongst purple pillars hall daenerys targaryen awaited upon ebon bench made throne eyes soft sleep silver gold hair tousled
grace said ser barristan selmy lord commander queensguard need see

dany paid heed dothraki wise horses concerned could utter fools much else girls besides handmaids age women grown look black hair copper skin almond shaped eyes children khal drogo given sun stars drogo given pelt head hide hrakkar white lion dothraki sea big musty smell made feel drogo still near
grey worm appeared atop steps first torch hand bronze cap crested three spikes behind followed four unsullied bearing dead man shoulders caps one spike faces showed little might cast bronze well laid corpse feet ser barristan pulled back blood stained shroud grey worm lowered torch might see
dead mans face smooth hairless though cheeks slashed open almost ear ear tall man blue eyed fair face child lys old volantis snatched ship corsairs sold bondage red astapor though eyes open wounds wept wounds could count
grace ser barristan said harpy drawn bricks alley found
drawn blood daenerys knew way sons harpy butchery night kill left mark grey worm man alone partner unsullied walked streets meereen night always walked pairs
