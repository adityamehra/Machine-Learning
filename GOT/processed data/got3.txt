cavil chronology
books know reminder may order
book hold hands fifth volume song ice fire fourth volume feast crows however volume follow one traditional sense much run tandem
dance feast take story immediately events third volume series storm swords whereas feast focused events around kings landing iron islands dorne dance takes north castle black wall beyond across narrow sea pentos slavers bay pick tales tyrion lannister jon snow daenerys targaryen characters see preceding volume rather sequential two books parallel divided geographically rather chronologically
point
dance dragons longer book feast crows covers longer time period latter half volume notice certain viewpoint characters feast crows popping means think means narrative moved past time frame feast two streams rejoined
next winds winter wherein hope everybody shivering together

prologue
night rank smell man
warg stopped beneath tree sniffed grey brown fur dappled shadow sigh piney wind brought man scent fainter smells spoke fox hare seal stag even wolf man smells warg knew stink old skins dead sour near drowned beneath stronger scents smoke blood rot man stripped skins beasts wore hides hair
wargs fear man wolves hate hunger coiled belly gave low growl calling one eyed brother small sly sister raced trees packmates followed hard heels caught scent well ran saw eyes glimpsed ahead breath pack puffed warm white long grey jaws ice frozen paws hard stone hunt prey ahead flesh warg thought meat
man alone feeble thing big strong good sharp eyes dull ear deaf smells deer elk even hares faster bears boars fiercer fight men packs dangerous wolves closed prey warg heard wailing pup crust last nights snow breaking clumsy man paws rattle hardskins long grey claws men carried
swords voice inside whispered spears
trees grown icy teeth snarling bare brown branches one eye ripped undergrowth spraying snow packmates followed hill slope beyond wood opened men one female fur wrapped bundle clutched pup leave last voice whispered males danger roaring men warg could smell terror one wooden tooth tall flung hand shaking tooth sailed high
pack
one eyed brother knocked tooth thrower back snowdrift tore throat struggled sister slipped behind male took rear left female pup
tooth little one made bone dropped wargs jaws closed around leg fell wrapped arms around noisy pup underneath furs female skin bones dugs full milk sweetest meat pup wolf saved choicest parts brother around carcasses frozen snow turned pink red pack filled bellies
leagues away one room hut mud straw thatched roof smoke hole floor hard packed earth varamyr shivered coughed licked lips eyes red lips cracked throat dry parched taste blood fat filled mouth even swollen belly cried nourishment childs flesh thought remembering bump human meat sunk low hunger human meat could almost hear haggon growling men may eat flesh beasts beasts flesh men man eats flesh man abomination

wolf though never eaten meat men human teeth would grudge pack feast however wolves famished gaunt cold hungry prey two men woman babe arms fleeing defeat death would perished soon case exposure starvation way better quicker mercy
mercy said aloud throat raw felt good hear human voice even air smelled mold damp ground cold hard fire giving smoke heat moved close flames dared coughing shivering turns side throbbing wound opened blood soaked breeches knee dried hard brown crust
thistle warned might happen sewed best could shed said need rest let mend flesh tear open
thistle last companions spearwife tough old root warty windburnt wrinkled others deserted along way one one fell behind forged ahead making old villages milkwater hardhome lonely death woods varamyr know could care taken one chance one twins big man scarred face youth red hair afraid though one others might realized happening would turned killed haggons words haunted chance passed

death easily outrun however varamyr came upon dead woman wood knelt strip cloak never saw boy burst hiding drive long bone knife side rip cloak clutching fingers mother thistle told later boy run mothers cloak saw robbing
dead varamyr said wincing bone needle pierced flesh someone smashed head crow
crow hornfoot men saw needle pulled gash side closed savages whos left tame one mance dead free folk doomed thenns giants hornfoot men cave dwellers filed teeth men western shore chariots bone doomed well even crows might know yet black cloaked bastards would perish rest enemy coming
haggons rough voice echoed head die dozen deaths boy every one hurt true death comes live second life simpler sweeter say
varamyr sixskins would know truth soon enough could taste true death smoke hung acrid air feel heat beneath fingers slipped hand clothes touch wound chill though deep bones time would cold killed
last death fire burned first confusion thought archer wall pierced flaming arrow fire inside consuming pain
varamyr died nine times died spear thrust bears teeth throat wash blood brought forth stillborn cub died first death six fathers axe crashed skull even agonizing fire guts crackling along wings devouring tried fly terror fanned flames made burn hotter one moment soaring wall eagles eyes marking movements men flames turned heart blackened cinder sent spirit screaming back skin little hed gone mad even memory enough make shudder
noticed fire gone

gods gave answer smoke ceased rise well already little hut growing colder varamyr flint tinder dry kindling would never get fire burning thistle called voice hoarse edged pain thistle
chin pointed nose flat mole one cheek four dark hairs growing ugly face hard yet would given much glimpse door hut taken left long gone two days three varamyr uncertain dark inside hut drifting sleep never quite sure day night outside wait shed said back food like fool hed waited dreaming haggon bump wrongs done long life days nights passed thistle returned wont coming back varamyr wondered given away could tell thinking looking muttered fever dream

varamyr could take beast wanted bend make flesh dog wolf bear badger
thistle thought

last tyrion lannister saw illyrio mopatis magister standing litter brocade robes massive shoulders slumped figure dwindled dust lord cheese looked almost small

come moonrise back saddles trotting eastward mantle stars old valyrian road glimmered ahead like long silver ribbon winding wood dale little tyrion lannister felt almost peace lomas longstrider told true roads wonder
lomas longstrider asked duck
scribe long dead said haldon spent life traveling world writing lands visited two books called wonders wonders made man

rode night tyrion sleeping fitfully dozing pommel waking suddenly time time would begin slip sideways saddle ser rolly would get hand yank upright dawn dwarfs legs aching cheeks chafed raw
next day reached site ghoyan drohe hard beside river fabled rhoyne said tyrion glimpsed slow green waterway atop rise
little rhoyne said duck
pleasant enough river suppose smallest fork trident twice wide three run swifter city impressive ghoyan drohe never large tyrion recalled histories fair place green flowering city canals fountains war dragons came thousand years later canals choked reeds mud pools stagnant water gave birth swarms flies broken stones temples palaces sinking back earth gnarled old willows grew thick along riverbanks
people still remained amidst squalor tending little gardens amongst weeds sound iron hooves ringing old valyrian road sent darting back holes theyd crawled bolder ones lingered sun long enough stare passing riders dull incurious eyes one naked girl mud knees could seem take eyes tyrion never seen dwarf realized much less dwarf without nose made face stuck tongue girl began cry
duck asked
blew kiss girls cry kiss
beyond tangled willows road ended abruptly turned north short ways rode beside water brush gave way found beside old stone quay half submerged surrounded tall brown weeds duck came shout haldon tyrion craned head one side saw boy standing roof low wooden building waving wide brimmed straw hat lithe well made youth lanky build shock dark blue hair dwarf put age fifteen sixteen near enough make matter

life aboard selaesori qhoran nothing tedious tyrion found exciting part day pricking toes fingers knife river wonders behold giant turtles ruined cities stone men naked septas one never knew might lurking around next bend days nights sea leaving volantis cog sailed within sight land first tyrion could gaze passing headlands watch clouds seabirds rise stony cliffs crumbling watchtowers count bare brown islands slipped past saw many ships well fishing boats lumbering merchantmen proud galleys oars lashing waves white foam struck deeper waters sea sky air water water looked like water sky looked like sky sometimes cloud much blue
nights worse tyrion slept badly best times far sleep meant dreams like dreams sorrows waited stony king fathers face left beggars choice climbing hammock listening jorah mormont snore beneath remaining abovedecks contemplate sea moonless nights water black maesters ink horizon horizon dark deep forbidding beautiful chilly sort way looked long tyrion found musing easy would slip gunwale drop darkness one small splash pathetic little tale life would soon done hell fathers waiting
best part evening supper food especially good plentiful dwarf went next galley took meals cramped uncomfortable space ceiling low taller passengers always danger cracking heads hazard strapping slave soldiers fiery hand seemed particularly prone much tyrion enjoyed sniggering come prefer taking meals alone sitting crowded table men share common language listening talk jape whilst understanding none quickly grown wearisome particularly since always found wondering japes laughter directed
galley also ships books kept captain especially bookish man carried threea collection nautical poetry went bad worse well thumbed tome erotic adventures young slave girl lysene pillow house fourth final volume life triarch belicho famous volantene patriot whose unbroken succession conquests triumphs ended rather abruptly eaten giants tyrion finished third day sea lack books started reading slave girls story worst written engrossing one took evening see supper buttered beets cold fish stew biscuits could used drive nails

salt air lay still heavy morning western sky fiery red streaked lowering clouds glowed bright lannister crimson sailors dashing battening hatches running lines clearing decks lashing everything already lashed bad wind coming one warned nose get
tyrion remembered storm hed suffered crossing narrow sea way deck jumped beneath feet hideous creaking sounds ship made taste wine vomit nose stay gods wanted would sooner die drowning choking vomit overhead cogs canvas sail rippled slowly like fur great beast stirring long sleep filled sudden crack turned every head ship
winds drove cog far chosen course behind black clouds piled one atop another blood red sky midmorning could see lightning flickering west followed distant crash thunder sea grew rougher dark waves rose smash hull stinky steward crew started hauling canvas tyrion underfoot amidships climbed forecastle hunkered savoring lash cold rain cheeks cog went bucking wildly horse hed ever ridden lifting wave sliding troughs jarring bones even better could see locked airless cabin
time storm broke evening upon tyrion lannister soaked smallclothes yet somehow felt elated even later found drunken jorah mormont pool vomit cabin
dwarf lingered galley supper celebrating survival sharing tots black tar rum ships cook great greasy loutish volantene spoke one word common tongue fuck played ferocious game cyvasse particularly drunk played three games night tyrion first lost two decided hed enough stumbled back deck clear head rum elephants alike
found penny forecastle often found ser jorah standing rail beside cogs hideous half rotted figurehead gazing across inky sea behind looked small vulnerable child
tyrion thought best leave undisturbed late heard hugor hill

penny turned back

dwarf girl seen frequently deck next day tyrion encountered spotted sow amidships midafternoon air warm sea calm name pretty girl told shyly
pretty pig penny girl thought someone deal answer penny gave tyrion acorns let pretty eat hand think dont see girl thought big sow snuffled squealed

night came right asked would like tilt answered later occur perhaps tilt mean tilt answer would still might brusque
back cabin shared jorah mormont tyrion twisted hammock hours slipping sleep dreams full grey stony hands reaching fog stair led father
finally gave made way top breath night air selaesori qhoran furled big striped sail night decks deserted one mates sterncastle amidships moqorro sat brazier small flames still danced amongst embers
brightest stars visible west dull red glow lit sky northeast color blood bruise tyrion never seen bigger moon monstrous swollen looked swallowed sun woken fever twin floating sea beyond ship shimmered red every wave hour asked moqorro cannot sunrise unless east moved sky red

captain would prefer fifty leagues farther sea well away accursed shore commanded steer shortest course others seek daenerys
griff young prince could talk golden company sailing west feint tyrion considered saying something thought better seemed prophecy drove red priests room one hero second targaryen would serve confuse seen others fires asked warily
shadows moqorro said one tall twisted thing one black eye ten long arms sailing sea blood

pretend well said tyrion examining shirt heavy iron mail full holes almost looked moth eaten sort moths eat chainmail pretending dead one way survive battle good armor another though precious little fear green fork fought mismatched scraps plate lord leffords wagons spiked bucket helm made look someone upended slops pail head company steel worse old ill fitting dinted cracked brittle dried blood rust sniffed still could sure
heres crossbow penny showed
tyrion glanced cannot use stirrup winch legs long enough crank would serve better though truth told want crossbow took long reload even lurked latrine ditch waiting enemy take squat chances losing one quarrel would good
instead picked morningstar gave swing put heavy passed warhammer long studded mace also heavy half dozen longswords found dirk liked nasty piece steel triangular blade might serve said blade bit rust would make nastier found wood leather sheath fit slipped dirk inside
little sword little man joked penny

lip pit ahead quentyn edged forward slowly moving torch side side walls floor ceiling drank light scorched realized bricks burned black crumbling ash air grew warmer every step took began sweat
two eyes rose
bronze brighter polished shields glowing heat burning behind veil smoke rising dragons nostrils light quentyns torch washed scales dark green green moss deep woods dusk last light fades dragon opened mouth light heat washed behind fence sharp black teeth glimpsed furnace glow shimmer sleeping fire hundred times brighter torch dragons head larger horses neck stretched uncoiling like great green serpent head rose two glowing bronze eyes staring

quentyn said coughed coughed
air thick smoke sulfur stench choking
