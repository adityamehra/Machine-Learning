long ride gared pointed eight days maybe nine night falling
ser waymar royce glanced sky disinterest every day time unmanned dark gared
could see tightness around gareds mouth barely suppressed anger eyes thick black hood cloak gared spent forty years nights watch man boy accustomed made light yet wounded pride could sense something else older man could taste nervous tension came perilous close fear

nothing done order given honor bound obey
went front shaggy little garron picking way carefully undergrowth light snow fallen night stones roots hidden sinks lying crust waiting careless unwary ser waymar royce came next great black destrier snorting impatiently warhorse wrong mount ranging try tell lordling gared brought rear old man arms muttered rode
twilight deepened cloudless sky turned deep purple color old bruise faded black stars began come half moon rose grateful light

ser waymar royce deign reply
somewhere wood wolf howled
pulled garron beneath ancient gnarled ironwood dismounted
stopping ser waymar asked
best go rest way foot mlord ridge
royce paused moment staring distance face reflective cold wind whispered trees great sable cloak stirred behind like something half alive
theres something wrong gared muttered
young knight gave disdainful smile
cant feel gared asked listen darkness
could feel four years nights watch never afraid
wind trees rustling wolf sound unmans gared gared answer royce slid gracefully saddle tied destrier securely low hanging limb well away horses drew longsword sheath jewels glittered hilt moonlight ran shining steel splendid weapon castle forged new made look doubted ever swung anger
trees press close warned sword tangle mlord better knife
need instruction ask young lord said gared stay guard horses
gared dismounted need fire ill see
big fool old man enemies wood fire last thing want
theres enemies fire keep away gared said bears direwolves things
ser waymars mouth became hard line fire
gareds hood shadowed face could see hard glitter eyes stared knight moment afraid older man would go sword short ugly thing grip discolored sweat edge nicked hard use would given iron bob lordlings life gared pulled scabbard
finally gared looked fire muttered low breath
royce took acquiescence turned away lead said
threaded way thicket started slope low ridge found vantage point sentinel tree thin crust snow ground damp muddy slick footing rocks hidden roots trip made sound climbed behind heard soft metallic slither lordlings ringmail rustle leaves muttered curses reaching branches grabbed longsword tugged splendid sable cloak
great sentinel right top ridge known would lowest branches bare foot ground slid underneath flat belly snow mud looked empty clearing
heart stopped chest moment dared breathe moonlight shone clearing ashes firepit snow covered lean great rock little half frozen stream everything hours ago
gone bodies gone
gods heard behind sword slashed branch ser waymar royce gained ridge stood beside sentinel longsword hand cloak billowing behind wind came outlined nobly stars see
get whispered urgently somethings wrong
royce move looked empty clearing laughed dead men seem moved camp
wills voice abandoned groped words come possible eyes swept back forth abandoned campsite stopped axe huge double bladed battle axe still lying seen last untouched valuable weapon
feet ser waymar commanded theres one wont hiding bush
reluctantly obeyed
ser waymar looked open disapproval going back castle black failure first ranging find men glanced around tree quick look fire
turned away wordless use argue wind moving cut right went tree vaulting grey green sentinel began climb soon hands sticky sap lost among needles fear filled gut like meal could digest whispered prayer nameless gods wood slipped dirk free sheath put teeth keep hands free climbing taste cold iron mouth gave comfort
lordling called suddenly goes heard uncertainty challenge stopped climbing listened watched
woods gave answer rustle leaves icy rush stream distant hoot snow owl
others made sound
saw movement corner eye pale shapes gliding wood turned head glimpsed white shadow darkness gone branches stirred gently wind scratching one another wooden fingers opened mouth call warning words seemed freeze throat perhaps wrong perhaps bird reflection snow trick moonlight seen
ser waymar called see anything turning slow circle suddenly wary sword hand must felt felt nothing see answer cold
cold shivering clung tightly perch face pressed hard trunk sentinel could feel sweet sticky sap cheek
shadow emerged dark wood stood front royce tall gaunt hard old bones flesh pale milk armor seemed change color moved white new fallen snow black shadow everywhere dappled deep grey green trees patterns ran like moonlight water every step took
heard breath go ser waymar royce long hiss come farther lordling warned voice cracked like boys threw long sable cloak back shoulders free arms battle took sword hands wind stopped cold
slid forward silent feet hand longsword like none ever seen human metal gone forging blade alive moonlight translucent shard crystal thin seemed almost vanish seen edge faint blue shimmer thing ghost light played around edges somehow knew sharper razor
ser waymar met bravely dance lifted sword high head defiant hands trembled weight perhaps cold yet moment thought boy longer man nights watch
halted saw eyes blue deeper bluer human eyes blue burned like ice fixed longsword trembling high watched moonlight running cold along metal heartbeat dared hope
emerged silently shadows twins first three four five ser waymar may felt cold came never saw never heard call duty death shivered hugged tree kept silence
pale sword came shivering air
ser waymar met steel blades met ring metal metal high thin sound edge hearing like animal screaming pain royce checked second blow third fell back step another flurry blows fell back
behind right left around watchers stood patient faceless silent shifting patterns delicate armor making invisible wood yet made move interfere
swords met wanted cover ears strange anguished keening clash ser waymar panting effort breath steaming moonlight blade white frost others danced pale blue light
royces parry came beat late pale sword bit ringmail beneath arm young lord cried pain blood welled rings steamed cold droplets seemed red fire touched snow ser waymars fingers brushed side moleskin glove came away soaked red
said something language know voice like cracking ice winter lake words mocking
ser waymar royce found fury robert shouted came snarling lifting frost covered longsword hands swinging around flat sidearm slash weight behind others parry almost lazy
blades touched steel shattered
scream echoed forest night longsword shivered hundred brittle pieces shards scattering like rain needles royce went knees shrieking covered eyes blood welled fingers
watchers moved forward together signal given swords rose fell deathly silence cold butchery pale blades sliced ringmail silk closed eyes far beneath heard voices laughter sharp icicles
found courage look long time passed ridge empty
stayed tree scarce daring breathe moon crept slowly across black sky finally muscles cramping fingers numb cold climbed
royces body lay facedown snow one arm outflung thick sable cloak slashed dozen places lying dead like saw young boy
found left sword feet away end splintered twisted like tree struck lightning knelt looked around warily snatched broken sword would proof gared would know make surely old bear mormont maester aemon would gared still waiting horses hurry
rose ser waymar royce stood
fine clothes tatter face ruin shard sword transfixed blind white pupil left eye
right eye open pupil burned blue saw
broken sword fell nerveless fingers closed eyes pray long elegant hands brushed cheek tightened around throat gloved finest moleskin sticky blood yet touch icy cold

bran
seemed though falling years
fly voice whispered darkness bran know fly could fall
maester luwin made little boy clay baked till hard brittle dressed brans clothes flung roof bran remembered way shattered never fall said falling
ground far could barely make grey mists whirled around could feel fast falling knew waiting even dreams could fall forever would wake instant hit ground knew always woke instant hit ground
dont voice asked
ground closer still far far away thousand miles away closer cold darkness sun stars ground coming smash grey mists whispering voice wanted cry
cry fly
cant fly bran said cant cant
know ever tried
voice high thin bran looked around see coming crow spiraling reach following fell help said
trying crow replied say got corn
bran reached pocket darkness spun dizzily around pulled hand golden kernels slid fingers air fell
crow landed hand began eat
really crow bran asked
really falling crow asked back
dream bran said
asked crow
ill wake hit ground bran told bird
youll die hit ground crow said went back eating corn
bran looked could see mountains peaks white snow silver thread rivers dark woods closed eyes began cry
wont good crow said told answer flying crying hard crow took air flapped around brans hand
wings bran pointed

bran felt along shoulders groping feathers
different kinds wings crow said
bran staring arms legs skinny skin stretched taut bones always thin tried remember face swam grey mist shining light golden things love said
bran screamed
crow took air cawing shrieked forget need put aside put away landed brans shoulder pecked shining golden face gone
bran falling faster ever grey mists howled around plunged toward earth asked crow tearful
teaching fly
cant fly
youre flying right
falling
every flight begins fall crow said look
afraid
look
bran looked felt insides turn water ground rushing whole world spread tapestry white brown green could see everything clearly moment forgot afraid could see whole realm everyone
saw winterfell eagles see tall towers looking squat stubby castle walls lines dirt saw maester luwin balcony studying sky polished bronze tube frowning made notes book saw brother robb taller stronger remembered practicing swordplay yard real steel hand saw hodor simple giant stables carrying anvil mikkens forge hefting onto shoulder easily another man might heft bale hay heart godswood great white weirwood brooded reflection black pool leaves rustling chill wind felt bran watching lifted eyes still waters stared back knowingly
looked east saw galley racing across waters bite saw mother sitting alone cabin looking bloodstained knife table front rowers pulled oars ser rodrik leaned across rail shaking heaving storm gathering ahead vast dark roaring lashed lightning somehow could see
looked south saw great blue green rush trident saw father pleading king face etched grief saw sansa crying sleep night saw arya watching silence holding secrets hard heart shadows around one shadow dark ash terrible face hound another armored like sun golden beautiful loomed giant armor made stone opened visor nothing inside darkness thick black blood
lifted eyes saw clear across narrow sea free cities green dothraki sea beyond vaes dothrak mountain fabled lands jade sea asshai shadow dragons stirred beneath sunrise
finally looked north saw wall shining like blue crystal bastard brother jon sleeping alone cold bed skin growing pale hard memory warmth fled looked past wall past endless forests cloaked snow past frozen shore great blue white rivers ice dead plains nothing grew lived north north north looked curtain light end world beyond curtain looked deep heart winter cried afraid heat tears burned cheeks
know crow whispered sat shoulder know must live
bran said understanding falling falling
winter coming
bran looked crow shoulder crow looked back three eyes third eye full terrible knowledge bran looked nothing snow cold death frozen wasteland jagged blue white spires ice waited embrace flew like spears saw bones thousand dreamers impaled upon points desperately afraid
man still brave hes afraid heard voice saying small far away
fathers voice replied time man brave
bran crow urged choose fly die
death reached screaming
bran spread arms flew
wings unseen drank wind filled pulled upward terrible needles ice receded sky opened bran soared better climbing better anything world grew small beneath
flying cried delight
ive noticed said three eyed crow took air flapping wings face slowing blinding faltered air pinions beat cheeks beak stabbed fiercely bran felt sudden blinding pain middle forehead eyes
shrieked
crow opened beak cawed shrill scream fear grey mists shuddered swirled around ripped away like veil saw crow really woman serving woman long black hair knew somewhere winterfell yes remembered realized winterfell bed high chilly tower room black haired woman dropped basin water shatter floor ran steps shouting hes awake hes awake hes awake
bran touched forehead eyes place crow pecked still burning nothing blood wound felt weak dizzy tried get bed nothing happened
movement beside bed something landed lightly legs felt nothing pair yellow eyes looked shining like sun window open cold room warmth came wolf enfolded like hot bath pup bran realized big reached pet hand trembling like leaf
brother robb burst room breathless dash tower steps direwolf licking brans face bran looked calmly name summer said

certainly fastest ships available white harbor catelyn ser rodrik cassel arrived headlong gallop downriver tyroshi notorious avarice ser rodrik argued hiring fishing sloop three sisters catelyn insisted galley good winds much voyage without galleys oars theyd still beating way past fingers instead skimming toward kings landing journeys end
close thought beneath linen bandages fingers still throbbed dagger bitten pain scourge catelyn felt lest forget could bend last two fingers left hand others would never dexterous yet small enough price pay brans life

time jon left armory almost midday sun broken clouds turned back lifted eyes wall blazing blue crystalline sunlight even weeks sight still gave shivers centuries windblown dirt pocked scoured covering like film often seemed pale grey color overcast sky sun caught fair bright day shone alive light colossal blue white cliff filled half sky
largest structure ever built hands man benjen stark told jon kingsroad first caught sight wall distance beyond doubt useless tyrion lannister added grin even imp grew silent rode closer could see miles pale blue line across northern horizon stretching away east west vanishing far distance immense unbroken end world seemed say
finally spied castle black timbered keeps stone towers looked like nothing handful toy blocks scattered snow beneath vast wall ice ancient stronghold black brothers winterfell true castle lacking walls could defended south east west north concerned nights watch north loomed wall almost seven hundred feet high stood three times height tallest tower stronghold sheltered uncle said top wide enough dozen armored knights ride abreast gaunt outlines huge catapults monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry like skeletons great birds among walked men black small ants
stood outside armory looking jon felt almost overwhelmed day kingsroad hed seen first time wall like sometimes could almost forget way forgot sky earth underfoot times seemed nothing else world older seven kingdoms stood beneath looked made jon dizzy could feel great weight ice pressing topple somehow jon knew fell world fell

bitter cold outside bundled thickly furs tyrion lannister pulled gloves nodded poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside commanders keep set across yard chambers kings tower walking briskly legs could manage patches snow crunched beneath feet boots broke nights crust breath steamed like banner shoved hands armpits walked faster praying morrec remembered warm bed hot bricks fire
behind kings tower wall glimmered light moon immense mysterious tyrion stopped moment look legs ached cold haste
suddenly strange madness took hold yearning look end world would last chance thought tomorrow would ride south could imagine would ever want return frozen desolation kings tower promise warmth soft bed yet tyrion found walking past toward vast pale palisade wall
wooden stair ascended south face anchored huge rough hewn beams sunk deep ice frozen place back forth switched clawing way upward crooked bolt lightning black brothers assured much stronger looked tyrions legs cramping badly even contemplate ascent went instead iron cage beside well clambered inside yanked hard bell rope three quick pulls
wait seemed eternity standing inside bars wall back long enough tyrion begin wonder decided forget sudden whim go bed cage gave jerk began ascend
moved upward slowly fits starts first smoothly ground fell away beneath cage swung tyrion wrapped hands around iron bars could feel cold metal even gloves morrec fire burning room noted approval lord commanders tower dark old bear sense seemed
towers still inching way upward castle black lay etched moonlight could see stark empty windowless keeps crumbling walls courtyards choked broken stone farther could see lights moles town little village half league south along kingsroad bright glitter moonlight water icy streams descended mountain heights cut across plains rest world bleak emptiness windswept hills rocky fields spotted snow
finally thick voice behind said seven hells dwarf cage jerked sudden stop hung swinging slowly back forth ropes creaking
bring damn grunt loud groaning wood cage slid sideways wall beneath tyrion waited swinging stopped pushed open cage door hopped onto ice heavy figure black leaning winch second held cage gloved hand faces muffled woolen scarves eyes showed plump layers wool leather black black wanting time night one winch asked
last look
men exchanged sour glances look want one said care dont fall little man old bear would hides small wooden shack stood great crane tyrion saw dull glow brazier felt brief gust warmth winch men opened door went back inside alone
bitingly cold wind pulled clothes like insistent lover top wall wider kingsroad often tyrion fear falling although footing slicker would liked brothers spread crushed stone across walkways weight countless footsteps would melt wall beneath ice would seem grow around gravel swallowing path bare time crush stone
still nothing tyrion could manage looked east west wall stretching vast white road beginning end dark abyss either side west decided special reason began walk way following pathway nearest north edge gravel looked freshest
bare cheeks ruddy cold legs complained loudly every step tyrion ignored wind swirled around gravel crunched beneath boots ahead white ribbon followed lines hills rising higher higher lost beyond western horizon passed massive catapult tall city wall base sunk deep wall throwing arm taken repairs forgotten lay like broken toy half embedded ice
far side catapult muffled voice called challenge goes halt
tyrion stopped halt long ill freeze place jon said shaggy pale shape slid toward silently sniffed furs ghost
jon snow moved closer looked bigger heavier layers fur leather hood cloak pulled face lannister said yanking loose scarf uncover mouth last place would expected see carried heavy spear tipped iron taller sword hung side leather sheath across chest gleaming black warhorn banded silver

clean handmaids helped water irri jhiqui fanned dry doreah brushed hair fell like river liquid silver back scented spiceflower cinnamon touch wrist behind ears tips milk heavy breasts last dab sex irris finger felt light cool lovers kiss slid softly lips
afterward dany sent away might prepare khal drogo final ride night lands washed body clean brushed oiled hair running fingers last time feeling weight remembering first time touched night wedding ride hair never cut many men could die hair uncut buried face inhaled dark fragrance oils smelled like grass warm earth like smoke semen horses smelled like drogo forgive sun life thought forgive done must paid price star high high

sun going called back carry body pyre dothraki watched silence jhogo aggo bore tent dany walked behind laid cushions silks head toward mother mountains far northeast
oil commanded brought forth jars poured pyre soaking silks brush bundles dry grass oil trickled beneath logs air rich fragrance bring eggs dany commanded handmaids something voice made run

dany took torch aggos hand thrust logs oil took fire brush dried grass heartbeat later tiny flames went darting wood like swift red mice skating oil leaping bark branch leaf rising heat puffed face soft sudden lovers breath seconds grown hot bear dany stepped backward wood crackled louder louder mirri maz duur began sing shrill ululating voice flames whirled writhed racing platform dusk shimmered air seemed liquefy heat dany heard logs spit crack fires swept mirri maz duur song grew louder shriller gasped song became shuddering wail thin high full agony
flames reached drogo around clothing took fire instant khal clad wisps floating orange silk tendrils curling smoke grey greasy danys lips parted found holding breath part wanted go ser jorah feared rush flames beg forgiveness take inside one last time fire melting flesh bones one forever
could smell odor burning flesh different horseflesh roasting firepit pyre roared deepening dusk like great beast drowning fainter sound mirri maz duurs screaming sending long tongues flame lick belly night smoke grew thicker dothraki backed away coughing huge orange gouts fire unfurled banners hellish wind logs hissing cracking glowing cinders rising smoke float away dark like many newborn fireflies heat beat air great red wings driving dothraki back driving even mormont dany stood ground blood dragon fire
sensed truth long ago dany thought took step closer conflagration brazier hot enough flames writhed like women danced wedding whirling singing spinning yellow orange crimson veils fearsome behold yet lovely lovely alive heat dany opened arms skin flushed glowing wedding thought mirri maz duur fallen silent godswife thought child children grow children learn
another step dany could feel heat sand soles feet even sandals sweat ran thighs breasts rivulets cheeks tears run ser jorah shouting behind matter anymore fire mattered flames beautiful loveliest things ever seen one sorcerer robed yellow orange scarlet swirling long smoky cloaks saw crimson firelions great yellow serpents unicorns made pale blue flame saw fish foxes monsters wolves bright birds flowering trees beautiful last saw horse great grey stallion limned smoke flowing mane nimbus blue flame yes love sun stars yes mount ride
vest begun smolder dany shrugged let fall ground painted leather burst sudden flame skipped closer fire breasts bare blaze streams milk flowing red swollen nipples thought instant glimpsed khal drogo mounted smoky stallion flaming lash hand smiled whip snaked pyre hissing
heard crack sound shattering stone platform wood brush grass began shift collapse upon bits burning wood slid dany showered ash cinders something else came crashing bouncing rolling land feet chunk curved rock pale veined gold broken smoking roaring filled world yet dimly firefall dany heard women shriek children cry wonder
death pay life
came second crack loud sharp thunder smoke stirred whirled around pyre shifted logs exploding fire touched secret hearts heard screams frightened horses voices dothraki raised shouts fear terror ser jorah calling name cursing wanted shout good knight fear fire mine daenerys stormborn daughter dragons bride dragons mother dragons dont see dont see belch flame smoke reached thirty feet sky pyre collapsed came around unafraid dany stepped forward firestorm calling children
third crack loud sharp breaking world
fire died last ground became cool enough walk upon ser jorah mormont found amidst ashes surrounded blackened logs bits glowing ember burnt bones man woman stallion naked covered soot clothes turned ash beautiful hair crisped away yet unhurt
cream gold dragon suckling left breast green bronze right arms cradled close black scarlet beast draped across shoulders long sinuous neck coiled chin saw jorah raised head looked eyes red coals
wordless knight fell knees men khas came behind jhogo first lay arakh feet blood blood murmured pushing face smoking earth blood blood heard aggo echo blood blood rakharo shouted
came handmaids others dothraki men women children dany look eyes know today tomorrow forever never drogos
daenerys targaryen rose feet black hissed pale smoke venting mouth nostrils two pulled away breasts added voices call translucent wings unfolding stirring air first time hundreds years night came alive music dragons
