tarth beautiful wench grunted strokes sapphire isle called quiet monster unless mean make gag
shes rude well isnt coz jaime asked ser cleos though steel spine ill grant many men dare name monster face though behind back speak freely enough doubt
ser cleos coughed nervously lady brienne lies catelyn stark doubt starks cannot hope defeat swords ser make war poisoned words
defeat swords chinless cretin jaime smiled knowingly men read sorts things knowing smile let cousin cleos truly swallowed kettle dung striving ingratiate honest muttonhead lickspittle
ser cleos prattled blithely man whod believe sworn brother kingsguard would harm child know meaning honor
lickspittle truth told jaime come rue heaving brandon stark window cersei given end grief afterward boy refused die seven jaime shed berated even understood saw able frighten silence

downriver rising sun shimmered wind whipped surface river south shore red clay smooth road smaller streams fed greater rotting trunks drowned trees clung banks north shore wilder high rocky bluffs rose twenty feet crowned stands beech oak chestnut jaime spied watchtower heights ahead growing taller every stroke oars long upon knew stood abandoned weathered stones overgrown climbing roses
wind shifted ser cleos helped big wench run sail stiff triangle striped red blue canvas tully colors sure cause grief encountered lannister forces river sail brienne took rudder jaime threw leeboard chains rattling moved made better speed wind current favoring flight could save deal traveling delivered father instead brother pointed
lady catelyns daughters kings landing return girls
jaime turned ser cleos cousin lend knife
woman tensed armed voice unyielding stone
fears even irons cleos seems must ask shave leave beard take hair head
youd shaved bald asked cleos frey
realm knows jaime lannister beardless knight long golden hair bald man filthy yellow beard may pass unnoticed id sooner recognized irons
dagger sharp might cleos hacked away manfully sawing ripping way mats tossing hair side golden curls floated surface water gradually falling astern tangles vanished louse went crawling neck jaime caught crushed thumbnail ser cleos picked others scalp flicked water jaime doused head made ser cleos whet blade let scrape away last inch yellow stubble done trimmed back beard well
reflection water man know bald looked though aged five years dungeon face thinner hollows eyes lines remember dont look much like cersei way shell hate
midday ser cleos fallen asleep snores sounded like ducks mating jaime stretched watch world flow past dark cell every rock tree wonder
one room shacks came went perched tall poles made look like cranes folk lived saw sign birds flew overhead cried trees along shore jaime glimpsed silvery fish knifing water tully trout theres bad omen thought saw worseone floating logs passed turned dead man bloodless swollen cloak tangled roots fallen tree color unmistakably lannister crimson wondered corpse someone knew
forks trident easiest way move goods men across riverlands times peace would encountered fisherfolk skiffs grain barges poled downstream merchants selling needles bolts cloth floating shops perhaps even gaily painted mummers boat quilted sails half hundred colors making way upriver village village castle castle
war taken toll sailed past villages saw villagers empty net slashed torn hanging trees sign fisherfolk young girl watering horse rode soon glimpsed sail later passed dozen peasants digging field beneath shell burnt towerhouse men gazed dull eyes went back labors decided skiff threat
red fork wide slow meandering river loops bends dotted tiny wooded islets frequently choked sandbars snags lurked waters surface brienne seemed keen eye dangers though always seemed find channel jaime complimented knowledge river looked suspiciously said know river tarth island learned manage oars sail ever sat horse
ser cleos sat rubbed eyes gods arms sore hope wind lasts sniffed smell rain
jaime would welcome good rain dungeons riverrun cleanest place seven kingdoms must smell like overripe cheese
cleos squinted downriver smoke
thin grey finger crooked rising south bank several miles twisting curling jaime made smouldering remains large building live oak full dead women
crows scarcely started corpses thin ropes cut deeply soft flesh throats wind blew twisted swayed chivalrously done said brienne close enough see clearly true knight would condone wanton butchery
true knights see worse every time ride war wench said jaime worse yes
brienne turned rudder toward shore ill leave innocents food crows
heartless wench crows need eat well stay river leave dead alone woman
landed upstream great oak leaned water brienne lowered sail jaime climbed clumsy chains red fork filled boots soaked ragged breeches laughing dropped knees plunged head water came drenched dripping hands caked dirt rubbed clean current seemed thinner paler remembered legs stiff well unsteady put weight upon bloody long hoster tullys dungeon
brienne cleos dragged skiff onto bank corpses hung heads ripening death like foul fruit one need cut wench said
ill climb jaime waded ashore clanking get chains
wench staring one dead women jaime shuffled closer small stutter steps kind foot long chain permitted saw crude sign hung neck highest corpse smiled lay lions read oh yes woman unchivalrously done side mine wonder women
tavern wenches said ser cleos frey inn remember men escort spent night last returned riverrun nothing remained building stone foundation tangle collapsed beams charred black smoke still rose ashes
jaime left brothels whores brother tyrion cersei woman ever wanted girls pleasured lord fathers soldiers would seem perhaps served food drink thats earned traitors collars kiss cup ale glanced river make certain quite alone bracken land lord jonos might ordered killed father burned castle fear loves
might marq pipers work said ser cleos wisp wood beric dondarrion though id heard kills soldiers perhaps band roose boltons northmen
bolton defeated father green fork
broken said ser cleos came south lord tywin marched fords word riverrun hed taken harrenhal ser amory lorch
jaime liked sound brienne said granting courtesy name hopes might listen lord bolton holds harrenhal trident kingsroad likely watched
thought saw touch uncertainty big blue eyes protection theyd need kill
shouldnt think would trouble
good fighter said defensively one king renlys chosen seven hands cloaked striped silk rainbow guard
rainbow guard six girls singer said maids fair silk never met
woman turned red graves dig went climb tree
lower limbs oak big enough stand upon shed gotten trunk walked amongst leaves dagger hand cutting corpses flies swarmed around bodies fell stench grew worse one dropped deal trouble take whores ser cleos complained supposed dig spades use sword
brienne gave shout jumped rather climbing boat quick theres sail
made haste could though jaime could hardly run pulled back skiff cousin brienne shoved oar raised sail hurriedly ser cleos ill need row well
bid skiff began cut water bit faster current wind oars worked jaime sat chained peering upriver top sail visible way red fork looped looked across fields moving north behind screen trees moved south knew deceptive lifted hands shade eyes mud red watery blue announced
briennes big mouth worked soundlessly giving look cow chewing cud faster ser
inn soon vanished behind lost sight top sail well meant nothing pursuers swung around loop would become visible hope noble tullys stop bury dead whores suppose prospect returning cell appeal jaime tyrion could think something clever occurs go sword
good part hour played peek seek pursuers sweeping around bends small wooded isles starting hope somehow might left behind pursuit distant sail became visible ser cleos paused stroke others take wiped sweat brow
row brienne said
river galley coming jaime announced hed watched every stroke seemed grow little larger nine oars side means eighteen men crowded fighters well rowers larger sails cannot outrun
ser cleos froze oars eighteen said
six id want eight bracelets hinder somewhat jaime held wrists unless lady brienne would kind unshackle
ignored putting effort stroke
half nights start jaime said theyve rowing since dawn resting two oars time theyll exhausted sight sail given burst strength last ought able kill good many
ser cleos gaped eighteen
least likely twenty twenty five
cousin groaned cant hope defeat eighteen
say could best hope die swords hands perfectly sincere jaime lannister never afraid death
brienne broke rowing sweat stuck strands flax colored hair forehead grimace made look homelier ever protection said voice thick anger almost growl
laugh fierceness shes hound teats thought would teats speak protect wench free protect
galley skimming downriver great wooden dragonfly water around churned white furious action oars gaining visibly men deck crowding forward came metal glinted hands jaime could see bows well archers hated archers
prow onrushing galley stood stocky man bald head bushy grey eyebrows brawny arms mail wore soiled white surcoat weeping willow embroidered pale green cloak fastened silver trout riverruns captain guards day ser robin ryger notably tenacious fighter day done age hoster tully grown old lord
boats fifty yards apart jaime cupped hands around mouth shouted back water come wish godspeed ser robin
come take back kingslayer ser robin ryger bellowed youve lost golden hair
hope blind enemies sheen head worked well enough
ser robin unamused distance skiff galley shrunk forty yards throw oars weapons river one need harmed
ser cleos twisted around jaime tell freed lady catelyn exchange captives lawful
jaime told good catelyn stark rule riverrun ser robin shouted back four archers crowded position either side two standing two kneeling cast swords water
sword returned id stick belly hack balls four cravens
flight arrows answered one thudded mast two pierced sail fourth missed jaime foot
another red forks broad loops loomed brienne angled skiff across bend yard swung turned sail cracking filled wind ahead large island sat midstream main channel flowed right left cutoff ran island high bluffs north shore brienne moved tiller skiff sheared left sail rippling jaime watched eyes pretty eyes thought calm knew read mans eyes knew fear looked like determined desperate
thirty yards behind galley entering bend ser cleos take tiller wench commanded kingslayer take oar keep rocks
lady commands oar sword blade could break mans face well swung shaft could used parry

catelyn
ser desmond grell served house tully life squire catelyn born knight learned walk ride swim master arms day wed seen lord hosters little cat become young woman great lords lady mother king seen become traitor well
brother edmure named ser desmond castellan riverrun rode battle fell deal crime ease discomfort brought fathers steward dour utherydes wayn two men stood looked ser desmond stout red faced embarrassed utherydes grave gaunt melancholy waited speak given lives fathers service repaid disgrace catelyn thought wearily
sons ser desmond said last maester vyman told poor lads terrible terrible
share grief lady said utherydes wayn riverrun mourns
news must driven mad ser desmond broke madness grief mothers madness men understand know
catelyn said firmly understood knew treasonous fail punish men believe connived together free jaime lannister mine act mine alone alone must answer put kingslayers empty irons wear proudly must
fetters word seemed shock poor ser desmond kings mother lords daughter impossible
mayhaps said steward utherydes wayn lady would consent confined chambers ser edmure returns time alone pray murdered sons
confined aye ser desmond said confined tower cell would serve
confined let fathers chambers might comfort last days
ser desmond considered moment well shall lack comfort courtesy freedom castle denied visit sept need elsewise remain lord hosters chambers lord edmure returns
wish brother lord father lived catelyn correct set guard must give pledge shall attempt escape
ser desmond nodded plainly glad done distasteful task sad eyed utherydes wayn lingered moment castellan took leave grave thing lady naught ser desmond sent ser robin ryger bring back kingslayer failing head
catelyn expected less may warrior give strength sword arm brienne prayed done could nothing remained hope
things moved fathers bedchamber dominated great canopied bed born pillars carved shapes leaping trout father moved half turn stair sickbed placed face triangular balcony opened solar whence could see rivers always loved well
lord hoster sleeping catelyn entered went balcony stood one hand rough stone balustrade beyond point castle swift tumblestone joined placid red fork could see long way downriver striped sail comes east ser robin returning moment surface waters empty thanked gods went back inside sit father
catelyn could say lord hoster knew presence brought comfort gave solace would say knew crime father wondered would done lysa hands enemies would condemn call mothers madness
smell death room heavy smell sweet foul clinging reminded sons lost sweet bran little rickon slain hand theon greyjoy neds ward still grieved ned would always grieve ned babies taken well monstrous cruel thing lose child whispered softly father
lord hosters eyes opened tansy husked voice thick pain
know catelyn grown accustomed taking mother sister lysa tansy name strange catelyn said cat father
forgive blood oh please tansy
could another woman fathers life village maiden wronged young perhaps could found comfort serving wenchs arms mother died queer thought unsettling suddenly felt though known father tansy lord want send father would find woman still live
lord hoster groaned dead hand groped youll others sweet babes trueborn
others catelyn thought forgotten ned gone still talking tansy lysa mother
coughed sputum came bloody clutched fingers good wife gods bless sons trueborn sons aaahhh sudden spasm pain made lord hosters hand tighten nails dug hand gave muffled scream
maester vyman came quickly mix another dose milk poppy help lord swallow soon enough lord hoster tully fallen back heavy sleep
asking woman said cat tansy
tansy maester looked blankly
know one name serving girl woman nearby village perhaps someone years past catelyn gone riverrun long time
lady make inquiries like utherydes wayn would surely know person ever served riverrun tansy say smallfolk often name daughters flowers herbs maester looked thoughtful widow recall used come castle looking old shoes need new soles name tansy think pansy come many years
name violet said catelyn remembered old woman well
maester looked apologetic pardons lady catelyn may stay ser desmond decreed speak far duties require
must commands catelyn could blame ser desmond given small reason trust doubt feared might use loyalty many folk riverrun would still feel toward lords daughter work mischief free war least told little
maester gone donned woolen cloak stepped onto balcony sunlight shimmered rivers gilding surface waters rolled past castle catelyn shaded eyes glare searching distant sail dreading sight one nothing nothing meant hopes still alive
day watched well night legs ached standing raven came castle late afternoon flapping great black wings rookery dark wings dark words thought remembering last bird come horror brought
maester vyman returned evenfall minister lord tully bring catelyn modest supper bread cheese boiled beef horseradish spoke utherydes wayn lady quite certain woman name tansy ever riverrun service
raven today saw jaime taken slain gods forbid
lady weve word kingslayer
another battle edmure difficulty robb please kind put fears rest
lady vyman glanced make certain one else room lord tywin left riverlands alls quiet fords
whence came raven
west answered busying lord hosters bedclothes avoiding eyes
news robb
hesitated yes lady
something wrong knew manner hiding something tell robb hurt dead gods good please tell dead
grace took wound storming crag maester vyman said still evasive writes cause concern hopes return soon
wound sort wound serious
cause concern writes
wounds concern cared
certain maester crag tend doubt
wounded
lady commanded speak sorry gathering potions vyman made hurried exit catelyn left alone father milk poppy done work lord hoster sunk heavy sleep thin line spittle ran one corner open mouth dampen pillow catelyn took square linen wiped away gently touched lord hoster moaned forgive said softly could scarcely hear words tansy blood blood gods kind
words disturbed could say though could make sense blood thought must come back blood father woman needs much forgiveness
night catelyn slept fitfully haunted formless dreams children lost dead well break day woke fathers words echoing ears sweet babes trueborn would say unless could fathered bastard woman tansy could believe brother edmure yes would surprised learn edmure dozen natural children father lord hoster tully never
could tansy pet name called lysa way called cat lord hoster mistaken sister youll others said sweet babes trueborn lysa miscarried five times twice eyrie thrice kings landing never riverrun lord hoster would hand comfort never unless unless child first time
sister married day left fathers care new husbands ridden rejoin roberts rebellion afterward moon blood come accustomed time lysa gushed happily sons certain carried son heir winterfell mine eyrie oh theyll best friends like ned lord robert theyll brothers cousins truly know happy
lysas blood come long joy gone catelyn always thought lysa simply little late child
remembered first time gave sister robb hold small red faced squalling strong even full life sooner catelyn placed babe sisters arms lysas face dissolved tears hurriedly thrust baby back catelyn fled
lost child might explain fathers words much else besides lysas match lord arryn hastily arranged jon old man even older father old man without heir first two wives left childless brothers son murdered brandon stark kings landing gallant cousin died battle bells needed young wife house arryn continue young wife known fertile
catelyn rose threw robe descended steps darkened solar stand father sense helpless dread filled father said father know longer innocent bride head full dreams widow traitor grieving mother wise wise ways world made take whispered lysa price jon arryn pay swords spears house tully
small wonder sisters marriage loveless arryns proud prickly honor lord jon might wed lysa bind tullys cause rebellion hopes son would hard love woman came bed soiled unwilling would kind doubt dutiful yes lysa needed warmth
next day broke fast catelyn asked quill paper began letter sister vale arryn told lysa bran rickon struggling words mostly wrote father thoughts wrong time grows short maester vyman says dare make milk poppy stronger time father lay sword shield time rest yet fights grimly yield sake think needs forgiveness war made road eyrie riverrun dangerous travel know surely strong force knights could see safely mountains moon hundred men thousand cannot come write least words love might die peace write shall read ease way
even set quill aside asked sealing wax catelyn sensed letter like little late maester vyman believe lord hoster would linger long enough raven reach eyrie return though said much tully men surrender easily matter odds entrusted parchment maesters care catelyn went sept lit candle father fathers sake second crone let first raven world peered door death third mother lysa children lost
later day sat lord hosters bedside book reading passage heard sound loud voices trumpets blare ser robin thought flinching went balcony nothing seen rivers could hear voices clearly outside sound many horses clink armor cheer catelyn made way winding stairs roof keep ser desmond forbid roof told climbed
sounds coming far side castle main gate knot men stood portcullis rose jerks starts fields beyond outside castle several hundred riders wind blew lifted banners trembled relief sight leaping trout riverrun edmure
two hours saw fit come castle rang sound noisy reunions men embraced women children left behind three ravens risen rookery black wings beating air took flight catelyn watched fathers balcony washed hair changed clothing prepared brothers reproaches even waiting hard
last heard sounds outside door sat folded hands lap dried red mud spattered edmures boots greaves surcoat look would never know battle thin drawn pale cheeks unkempt beard bright eyes

joffrey thought tyrion
terrible defeat north certainly observed littlefinger yet one robb stark played part young wolf remains unbeaten field

run back riverrun plunder abandoning castles took west announced lord tywin cousin ser daven reforming remnants late fathers army lannisport ready shall join ser forley prester golden tooth soon stark boy starts north ser forley ser daven descend riverrun
certain lord stark means go north lord rowan asked even ironmen moat cailin
mace tyrell spoke anything pointless king without kingdom plain boy must abandon riverlands join forces roose boltons throw strength moat cailin would
tyrion bite tongue robb stark battles year lord highgarden twenty tyrells reputation rested one indecisive victory robert baratheon ashford battle largely lord tarlys van main host even arrived siege storms end mace tyrell actually hold command dragged year result trident fought lord highgarden meekly dipped banners eddard stark
ought write robb stark stern letter littlefinger saying understand man bolton stabling goats high hall really quite unconscionable
ser kevan lannister cleared throat regards starks balon greyjoy styles king isles north written offering terms alliance
ought offering fealty snapped cersei right call king
right conquest lord tywin said king balon stranglers fingers round neck robb starks heirs dead winterfell fallen ironmen hold moat cailin deepwood motte stony shore king balons longships command sunset sea well placed menace lannisport fair isle even highgarden provoke

tyrion stirred throw cell put trial life pointed certain amount rancor returned kings landing swear fealty joff commanded lords grant men sort lysa arryn could think nothing would enjoy except perhaps strangling cersei sometimes still dreamed eyries sky cells woke drenched cold sweat
mace tyrells smile jovial behind tyrion sensed contempt perhaps youd best leave fighting fighters said lord highgarden better men lost great armies mountains moon shattered bloody gate know worth lord need tempt fate
tyrion pushed cushions bristling father spoke could lash back tasks mind tyrion believe lord petyr may hold key eyrie
oh said littlefinger legs mischief grey green eyes lords leave propose travel vale woo win lady lysa arryn consort shall deliver vale arryn without drop blood spilled
lord rowan looked doubtful would lady lysa
shes times lord mathis voiced complaints

sheep bleating agreement unaware neatly theyd shorn fell tyrion object crown pay debts without lord petyr wizard coin one replace
littlefinger smiled little friend kind count coppers king robert used say clever tradesman could well lannister blessed golden touch casterly rock doubt far surpass
lannister tyrion bad feeling
lord tywins gold flecked eyes met sons mismatched ones admirably suited task believe

lord redwyne pinched nose may return matter greyjoy alliance view much said greyjoys longships augment fleet give sufficient strength sea assault dragonstone end stannis baratheons pretensions
king balons longships occupied nonce lord tywin said politely greyjoy demands half kingdom price alliance earn fight starks already pay given free best thing lord pyke nothing view granted enough time better option may well present one require king give half kingdom
tyrion watched father closely theres something hes saying remembered important letters lord tywin writing night tyrion demanded casterly rock said battles swords spears others quills ravens wondered better option sort price demanding
perhaps ought move wedding ser kevan said
high septon spoke preparations made great sept baelor cersei detailed plans making feast would feed thousand throne room many outside yards outer middle wards would tented silk tables food casks ale could accommodated within hall

thats much much sword joff tyrion said
grow feel weight offered weapon hilt first
sword much lighter expected turned hand saw one metal could beaten thin still strength enough fight mistaking ripples mark steel folded back many thousands times valyrian steel
yes lord tywin said tone deep satisfaction
long last father valyrian steel blades scarce costly yet thousands remained world perhaps two hundred seven kingdoms alone always irked father none belonged house lannister old kings rock owned weapon greatsword brightroar lost second king tommen carried back valyria fools quest never returned uncle gery youngest reckless fathers brothers gone seeking lost sword eight years past
thrice least lord tywin offered buy valyrian longswords impoverished lesser houses advances always firmly rebuffed little lordlings would gladly part daughters lannister come asking cherished old family swords
tyrion wondered metal one come master armorers could rework old valyrian steel secrets making lost doom came old valyria colors strange commented turned blade sunlight valyrian steel grey dark looked almost black true well blended folds red deep grey two colors lapped one another without ever touching ripple distinct like waves night blood upon steely shore get patterning ive never seen anything like
lord said armorer confess colors intended know could duplicate lord father asked crimson house color set infuse metal valyrian steel stubborn old swords remember said change easily worked half hundred spells brightened red time time always color would darken blade drinking sun folds would take red see lords lannister displeased course try many times require

tyrions hands clenched arms chair heard mean hear subject wifes maidenhead long discussing marriage hear nothing sisters impending nuptials recall
lord tywin cut mace tyrell refused offer marry cersei heir willas
refused sweet cersei put tyrion much better mood
first broached match lord tyrell seemed well enough disposed father said day later changed old womans work hectors son unmercifully varys claims told sister old used precious one legged grandson
cersei must loved laughed
lord tywin gave chilly look know better offer never made see remember tyrion offer never made
offer tyrion rather suspected lord tyrell might come regret rebuff
sister wed question several thoughts could get rap door guardsman stuck head announce grand maester pycelle may enter said lord tywin
pycelle tottered cane stopped long enough give tyrion look would curdle milk magnificent white beard someone unaccountably shaved growing back sparse wispy leaving unsightly pink wattles dangle beneath neck lord hand old man said bowing deeply could without falling another bird castle black mayhaps could consult privily
theres need lord tywin waved grand maester pycelle seat tyrion may stay
oooooh may rubbed nose waited
pycelle cleared throat involved deal coughing hawking letter bowen marsh sent last castellan writes lord mormont sent word wildlings moving south vast numbers

last lord mormont sent bird haunted forest report attack ravens returned since none letters bowen marsh fears lord mormont slain strength
tyrion rather liked old jeor mormont gruff manner talking bird certain asked
pycelle admitted none mormonts men returned yet marsh fears wildlings killed wall may attacked next fumbled robe found paper letter lord plea five kings wants men many men send
five kings father annoyed one king westeros fools black might try remember wish grace heed reply tell renly dead others traitors pretenders
doubt glad learn wall world apart news oft reaches late pycelle bobbed head shall tell marsh concerning men begs shall convene council

pycelle gave tyrion sly glance excellent thought lord know man janos slynt

tyrions anger flashed lord janos hollow suit armor sell highest bidder
count point favor like bid higher turned pycelle send raven write king joffrey deeply saddened hear lord commander mormonts death regrets spare men whilst many rebels usurpers remain field suggest matters might quite different throne secure provided king full confidence leadership watch closing ask marsh pass along graces fondest regards faithful friend servant lord janos slynt
yes lord pycelle bobbed withered head shall write hand commands great pleasure

catelyn
robb bid farewell young queen thrice godswood heart tree sight gods men second time beneath portcullis jeyne sent forth long embrace longer kiss finally hour beyond tumblestone girl came galloping well lathered horse plead young king take along
robb touched catelyn saw abashed well day damp grey drizzle begun fall last thing wanted call halt march could stand wet console tearful young wife front half army speaks gently thought watched together anger underneath
time king queen talking grey wind prowled around stopping shake water coat bare teeth rain last robb gave jeyne one final kiss dispatched dozen men take back riverrun mounted horse direwolf raced ahead swift arrow loosed longbow
queen jeyne loving heart see said lame lothar frey catelyn unlike sisters would wager guess even roslin dancing round twins chanting lady tully lady tully lady roslin tully morrow shell holding swatches riverrun red blue cheek picture shell look brides cloak turned saddle smile edmure strangely quiet lord tully feel wonder

lothar gave good natured laugh let pray marriage ends happily lord
may gods protect catelyn pressed heels horse leaving brother lame lothar others company
insisted jeyne remain riverrun robb would sooner kept side lord walder might well construe queens absence wedding another slight yet presence would different sort insult salt old mans wound walder frey sharp tongue long memory warned son doubt strong enough suffer old mans rebukes price allegiance much father sit insults jeyne face
robb could deny sense yet resents catelyn thought wearily misses jeyne already part blames absence though knows good counsel

catelyn would miss uncles craggy face robb would miss counsel ser brynden played part every victory son galbart glover taken command scouts outriders place good man loyal steady without blackfishs brilliance

gods would route took whispering wood robb first great victory followed course twisting stream floor pinched narrow valley much jaime lannisters men done fateful night warmer catelyn remembered trees still green stream overflow banks fallen leaves choked flow lay sodden snarls among rocks roots trees hidden robbs army exchanged green raiment leaves dull gold spotted brown red reminded rust dry blood spruce soldier pines still showed green thrusting belly clouds like tall dark spears
trees died since reflected night whispering wood ned still alive cell beneath aegons high hill bran rickon safe behind walls winterfell theon greyjoy fought robbs side boasted almost crossed swords kingslayer would theon died place lord karstarks sons much ill would undone
passed battleground catelyn glimpsed signs carnage overturned helm filling rain splintered lance bones horse stone cairns raised men fallen scavengers already amidst tumbles rock spied brightly colored cloth bits shiny metal saw face peering shape skull beginning emerge beneath melting brown flesh
made wonder ned come rest silent sisters taken bones north escorted hallis mollen small honor guard ned ever reached winterfell interred beside brother brandon dark crypts beneath castle door slam shut moat cailin hal sisters could pass
thirty five hundred riders wound way along valley floor heart whispering wood catelyn stark seldom felt lonelier every league crossed took farther riverrun found wondering whether would ever see castle lost forever like much else
five days later scouts rode back warn rising waters washed wooden bridge fairmarket galbart glover two bolder men tried swimming mounts across turbulent blue fork ramsford two horses swept drowned one riders glover managed cling rock could pull river hasnt run high since spring edmure said rain keeps falling go higher yet
theres bridge upstream near oldstones remembered catelyn often crossed lands father older smaller still stands

samwell
whitetree sam thought please let whitetree remembered whitetree whitetree maps hed drawn way north village whitetree knew please wanted badly forgot feet little bit forgot ache calves lower back stiff frozen fingers could scarcely feel even forgot lord mormont craster wights others whitetree sam prayed god might listening
wildling villages looked much alike though huge weirwood grew center one white tree mean whitetree necessarily hadnt weirwood whitetree bigger one maybe remembering wrong face carved bone pale trunk long sad red tears dried sap leaked eyes looked came north sam couldnt recall
around tree stood handful one room hovels sod roofs longhall built logs grown moss stone well sheepfold sheep people wildlings gone join mance rayder frostfangs taking owned except houses sam thankful night coming would good sleep beneath roof tired seemed though walking half life boots falling pieces blisters feet burst turned callus new blisters callus toes getting frostbitten
either walk die sam knew gilly still weak childbirth carrying babe besides needed horse second horse died three days crasters keep wonder lasted long poor half starved thing sams weight probably done might tried riding double afraid thing would happen better walk
sam left gilly longhall make fire poked head hovels better making fires could never seem get kindling catch last time hed tried strike spark flint steel managed cut knife gilly bound gash hand stiff sore even clumsier knew wash wound change binding afraid look besides cold hated taking gloves
sam know hoped find empty houses maybe wildlings left food behind take look jon searched huts whitetree way north inside one hovel sam heard rustling rats dark corner otherwise nothing old straw old smells ashes beneath smoke hole
turned back weirwood studied carved face moment face saw admitted trees half big one whitetree red eyes wept blood didnt remember either clumsily sam sank knees old gods hear prayer seven fathers gods said words joined watch help fear might lost hungry cold dont know gods believe please youre help gilly little son could think say dusk deepening leaves weirwood rustling softly waving like thousand blood red hands whether jons gods heard could say
time returned longhall gilly fire going sat close furs opened babe breast hes hungry sam thought old women smuggled food crasters eaten sam hopeless hunter even horn hill game plentiful hounds huntsmen help endless empty forest chances catching anything remote efforts fishing lakes half frozen streams dismal failures well
much longer sam gilly asked far still
far far sam shrugged pack eased awkwardly floor tried cross legs back ached abominably walking would liked lean one carved wooden pillars supported roof fire center hall beneath smoke hole craved warmth even comfort another days see
sam maps wasnt whitetree werent going much use went far east get around lake fretted maybe far west tried double back coming hate lakes rivers never ferry bridge meant walking way around lakes searching places ford rivers easier follow game trail struggle brush easier circle ridge instead climbing bannen dywen wed castle black warming feet common room bannen dead though dywen gone grenn dolorous edd others
wall three hundred miles long seven hundred feet high sam reminded kept going south find sooner later certain going south day took directions sun clear nights could follow ice dragons tail though hadnt traveled much night since second horse died even moon full dark beneath trees would easy sam last garron break leg well south
wasnt certain far east west might strayed would reach wall yes day fortnight couldnt farther surely surely gate castle black needed find way wall hundred leagues
wall big craster used say gilly asked
bigger sam tried sound cheerful big cant even see castles hidden behind theyre youll see wall ice castles stone wood tall towers deep vaults huge longhall great fire burning hearth day night hot gilly youll hardly believe
could stand fire boy long time till good warm
stand fire long like youll food drink hot mulled wine bowl venison stewed onions hobbs bread right oven hot burn fingers sam peeled glove wriggle fingers near flames soon regretted numb cold feeling returned hurt much almost cried sometimes one brothers sing said take mind pain dareon sang best sent eastwatch theres still halder though toad real name todder looks like toad call likes sing awful voice
sing gilly rearranged furs moved babe one breast
sam blushed know songs little liked sing danced lord father never liked said wanted prance around yard sword hand
could sing southron song babe
like sam thought moment theres song septon used sing sisters little time go sleep song seven called cleared throat softly sang
fathers face stern strong
sits judges right wrong
weighs lives short long
loves little children
mother gives gift life
watches every wife
gentle smile ends strife
loves little children
warrior stands foe
protecting eer go
sword shield spear bow
guards little children
crone wise old
sees fates unfold
lifts lamp shining gold
lead little children
smith labors day night
put world men right
hammer plow fire bright
builds little children
maiden dances sky
lives every lovers sigh
smiles teach birds fly
give dreams little children
seven gods made
listening call
close eyes shall fall
see little children
close eyes shall fall
see little children
sam remembered last time hed sung song mother lull baby dickon sleep father heard voices come barging angry lord randyll told wife harshly ruined one boy soft septons songs mean babe looked sam said go sing sisters must sing dont want near son
gillys babe gone sleep tiny thing quiet sam feared didnt even name asked gilly said bad luck name child two many died
tucked nipple back inside furs pretty sam sing good
hear dareon voice sweet mead
drank sweetest mead day craster made wife summer cold gilly gave puzzled look sing six gods craster always told southrons seven
seven agreed one sings stranger strangers face face death even talking made sam uncomfortable eat something bite two
nothing left black sausages hard wood sam sawed thin slices effort made wrist ache hungry enough persist chewed slices long enough softened tasted good crasters wives seasoned garlic

arya
reached top ridge saw river sandor clegane reined hard cursed
rain falling black iron sky pricking green brown torrent ten thousand swords must mile across arya thought tops half hundred trees poked swirling waters limbs clutching sky like arms drowning men thick mats sodden leaves choked shoreline farther channel glimpsed something pale swollen deer perhaps dead horse moving swiftly downstream sound low rumble edge hearing like sound dog makes growls

theres way across thought lord beric catch sure clegane pushed big black stallion hard doubling back thrice throw pursuit even riding half mile center swollen stream arya still expected see outlaws every time looked back tried help scratching name trunks trees went bushes make water fourth time caught end doesnt matter arya told thoros find flames hadnt yet anyway crossed river
harroway town shouldnt far hound said lord roote stables old king andahars two headed water horse maybe well ride across
arya never heard old king andahar shed never seen horse two heads either especially one could run water knew better ask held tongue sat stiff hound turned stallions head trotted along ridgeline following river downstream least rain backs way shed enough stinging eyes half blind washing cheeks like crying wolves never cry reminded

rode beside river hours splashing across two muddy vassal streams reached place sandor clegane spoken lord harroways town said saw seven hells town drowned desolate rising waters overflowed riverbanks remained harroway town upper story daub wattle inn seven sided dome sunken sept two thirds stone roundtower moldy thatch roofs forest chimneys

arya wondered outlaws taken cleganes gold maybe lord beric left silver copper ferry ride shouldnt cost coppers
ferrymen talking finally bent backed one turned away gave shout six men appeared pulling hoods keep rain heads still squirmed holdfast window leapt onto deck half looked enough like bent backed man kin undid chains took long poles others slid heavy wide bladed oars locks ferry swung began creep slowly toward shallows oars stroking smoothly either side sandor clegane rode hill meet

arya told big iron brazier glowing red filling room sullen suffocating heat felt pleasant stand beside warm hands dry little bit soon felt deck move feet slipped back forward door
two headed horse eased slowly shallows picking way chimneys rooftops drowned harroway dozen men labored oars four used long poles push whenever came close rock tree sunken house bent backed man rudder rain pattered smooth planks deck splashed tall carved horseheads fore aft arya getting soaked didnt care wanted see man crossbow still stood window roundtower saw eyes followed ferry slid underneath wondered lord roote hound mentioned doesnt look much like lord didnt look much like lady either
beyond town river proper current grew much stronger grey haze rain arya could make tall stone pillar far shore surely marked ferry landing sooner seen realized pushed away downstream oarsmen rowing vigorously fighting rage river leaves broken branches swirled past fast theyd fired scorpion men poles leaned shoved away anything came close windier whenever turned look upstream arya got face full blowing rain stranger screaming kicking deck moved underfoot
jumped side river would wash away hound even knew gone looked back shoulder saw sandor clegane struggling frightened horse trying calm would never better chance get away might drown though jon used say swam like fish even fish might trouble river still drowning might better kings landing thought joffrey crept prow river murky brown mud lashed rain looking like soup water arya wondered cold would couldnt get much wetter put hand rail
sudden shout snapped head could leap ferrymen rushing forward poles hand moment understand happening saw uprooted tree huge dark coming straight tangle roots limbs poked water came like reaching arms great kraken oarsmen backing water frantically trying avoid collision could capsize stove hull old man wrenched rudder horse prow swinging downstream slowly glistening brown black tree rushed toward like battering ram

maybe hell wash someplace downstream arya tried tell thought hollow ring lost desire go swimming sandor clegane shouted get back inside beat bloody went meekly ferry fighting turn back course river wanted nothing carry sea
finally came ashore good two miles downriver usual landing boat slammed bank hard another pole snapped arya almost lost feet sandor clegane lifted onto strangers back weighed doll boatmen stared dull exhausted eyes bent backed man held hand six dragons demanded three passage three man lost

found chatayas
chatayas bedded black skinned girl alayaya believe called exquisite despite stripes back whore referred sister
seduced yet tyrion asked unsurprised
oberyn laughed aloud meet price queen even hinted marriage grace needs another husband better prince dorne ellaria believes accept thought cersei bed makes wet randy wench even need pay dwarfs penny sister requires one head somewhat overlarge missing nose
said tyrion waiting
way answer prince oberyn swirled wine said young dragon conquered dorne long ago left lord highgarden rule submission sunspear tyrell moved tail keep keep chasing rebels making certain knees stayed bent would arrive force take castle stay moons turn ride next castle custom turn lords chambers take beds one night found beneath heavy velvet canopy sash hung near pillows wish summon wench taste dornish women lord tyrell blame pulled upon sash canopy split open hundred red scorpions fell upon head death lit fire soon swept across dorne undoing young dragons victories fortnight kneeling men stood free

father said prince oberyn may live forever
something way said made hairs back tyrions neck bristle suddenly mindful elia oberyn said crossed field ashes wants head spoke words hand swung sword wise speak treasons red keep prince little birds listening
let treason say man mortal valar morghulis said valyria old men must die doom came proved true dornishman went window gaze night said witnesses
hoping one look sweet face mine would enough persuade innocence
mistaken lord fat flower highgarden quite convinced guilt determined see die precious margaery drinking chalice reminded half hundred times
said tyrion
men seldom appear look guilty convinced innocence still likely condemned justice short supply side mountains none elia aegon rhaenys perhaps joffreys real killer eaten bear seems happen quite often kings landing oh wait bear harrenhal remember
game playing tyrion rubbed scarred nose nothing lose telling oberyn truth bear harrenhal kill ser amory lorch
sad said red viper noseless men lie badly wonder
lying ser amory dragged princess rhaenys fathers bed stabbed death men arms know names leaned forward ser gregor clegane smashed prince aegons head wall raped sister elia blood brains still hands
truth lannister oberyn smiled coldly father gave commands yes
spoke lie without hesitation never stopped ask
dornishman raised one thin black eyebrow dutiful son feeble lie lord tywin presented sisters children king robert wrapped crimson lannister cloaks
perhaps ought discussion father rock still young thought thing legs good pissing
yes difficulty would say innocence may plain scar face save father dornish prince smiled might
tyrion studied one judge three could save

epilogue
road oldstones went twice around hill reaching summit overgrown stony would slow going even best times last nights snow left muddy well snow autumn riverlands unnatural merrett thought gloomily much snow true enough blanket ground night started melting away soon sun came still merrett took bad omen rains floods fire war lost two harvests good part third early winter would mean famine across riverlands great many people would go hungry would starve merrett hoped wouldnt one may though luck may never luck
beneath castle ruins lower slopes hill thickly forested half hundred outlaws could well lurking could watching even merrett glanced saw nothing gorse bracken thistle sedge blackberry bushes pines grey green sentinels elsewhere skeletal elm ash scrub oaks choked ground like weeds saw outlaws meant little outlaws better hiding honest men
merrett hated woods truth told hated outlaws even outlaws stole life known complain cups often cups father said often loudly true thought ruefully needed sort distinction twins else liable forget alive reputation biggest drinker castle done little enhance prospects hed found hoped greatest knight ever couched lance gods took away shouldnt cup wine time time helps headaches besides wife shrew father despises children worthless stay sober

cursing breath merrett jammed heels horses flanks rode hill tempting drink gold away knew didnt come back petyr pimple well come back
lord walder would soon turn two ninety ears started go eyes almost gone gout bad carried everywhere could possibly last much longer sons agreed goes everything change better father querulous stubborn iron wasps tongue believe taking care even ones displeased disappointed even ones whose names cant remember gone though

merrett wasnt certain fortunate matter lothar might dangerous either lord walder ordered slaughter starks roslins wedding lame lothar plotted roose bolton way songs would played lothar amusing fellow get drunk merrett would never foolish turn back twins learned early full blood siblings could trusted far
like every son old man died every daughter well new lord crossing would doubtless keep uncles nephews cousins twins ones happened like trust likely ones thought would prove useful rest hell shove fend
prospect worried merrett words could say would forty less three years old take life hedge knight even hed knight happened wasnt land wealth owned clothes back much else even horse riding wasnt clever enough maester pious enough septon savage enough sellsword gods gave gift birth stinted good son rich powerful house ninth son took grandsons great grandsons account merrett stood better chance chosen high septon inheriting twins
