This project was inspired from `Udacity's Inroduction to Data Science` and [vudlabs](http://vudlab.com/simpsons/)

[Wikipedia Article on Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox)

# Background:
In 1973, the `University of California-Berkeley (UC-Berkeley) was sued for sex discrimination`. Its admission data showed that men applying to graduate school at UC-Berkley were more likely to be admitted than women.

The graduate schools had just accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants. The difference was so great that it was unlikely to be due to chance.

`By looking at the data more closely, you may realize that there is more to the story than meets the eye.`
